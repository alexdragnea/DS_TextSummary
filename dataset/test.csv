the problem many of us face when we set out to create change within our lives is losing trust within ourself our mind keeps mental tally of all the things we tell ourselves we re going to do and either builds up or breaks down trust depending upon the result for instance if out of no where we make the plan to go to the gym for an hour everyday for the next month without any prior consistency in working out we ll soon find ourselves missing day then two then abandoning the plan all together our mind becomes confused and loses trust in our own words when we re unable to stick to them this creates mental narrative along the lines of incapable or it must not be for me which soon becomes the go to language we speak to ourselves if instead we initially set the intention to go to the gym once week for minutes we may not find our physical muscles growing but we will find our mental muscle growing this mental muscle is what dictates our sense of character and ability to do hard things after month of weekly minute workouts at the gym we can very slowly stack more time more frequency and eventually expand this into new activities and skills we re looking to develop some people will say going to the gym once week for minutes what the point in that the point is that when we stick to our plans we develop confidence an inner trust that says capable of doing the things tell myself to do from this confidence we begin stacking one success upon another which further ingrains this inner trust the game of developing as human is all about mindset start small take small steps and before you know it you will see astonishing results,"When you struggle to stick to your plans, it's easy to feel like you can't trust yourself. To build trust, start with small goals you can achieve, like going to the gym for a short amount of time once a week.

live in the northeast and will be out for entire months of december january the house will be totally empty what is the checklist to make sure everything is in good shape in the house got security cameras but am not sure how else can keep the place safe also what else must do so that house stays in good shape,"If you will be away from your home for an extended period of time, there are several steps you should take to ensure that your house is well-maintained and secure. 

Firstly, double-check that all doors and windows are locked and secure. Consider notifying your neighbors of your absence and ask them to keep an eye on your home. You can also notify police or security services of your absence, especially if the house will be empty for an extended period of time. 

To keep your home in good shape, you should turn off all appliances, except for any that are necessary for maintaining a safe environment (such as a freezer). You should also adjust your thermostat to keep your home at a temperature that prevents your pipes from freezing. Hire a plumber to winterize your home if you anticipate very low temperatures. 

If you have any indoor plants, consider finding someone to care for them while you are away. You should also avoid posting about your trip on social media or telling many people about your absence, as this can indicate to potential burglars that your home will be empty."

Normal, everyday events are not deemed as newsworthy, whereas acts of violence and disaster sell headlines.

got food cooling on the counter that needs to go in the fridge gotta put the laundry in the dryer trash cans need to go out on the curb need to feed your sourdough starter okay that one might be less universally applicable put something on your pillow pair of clean socks hat book use little fish bookmark you might be bummed and go to bed little later than you planned but you ll definitely remember if you think you ll see the object and not remember what it is you have to do by all means write note and put it on your pillow the object on the pillow method is just the most streamlined and therefore easily achieved,"There are several ways to remind yourself to do something, such as putting a note on your pillow, putting objects that you need to take with you or do something with, like your lunch box by the door, or using an alarm or to-do list app on your phone.

Object on the pillow is probably the easiest to do if you are already in bed and have an important task you must not forget in the morning, like taking an medication with you.

Writing notes to yourself or using sticky notes can be very effective but requires more effort and may not be sustainable long term if you have lots of tasks and responsibilities. 

The most important thing is to find a system that works for you and that you will stick to."

just added this as comment on another thread and thought it may be worth putting here we all know using the restroom when out and about can be gross experience especially when stopping at gas stations or fast food places hotels however almost always have regular cleaning staff so they are generally much cleaner unfortunately if you are not guest you run the risk of being caught and asked to leave not the end of the world but can be embarrassing and annoying especially if you still have to go found solution and maybe it should go to ulpt used to do delivery doordash grubhub etc and still have my branded food bags so when need to go just grab one of them and carry it with me no one ever says anything about it and it means you can do it at the same places semi regularly without looking suspicious,"Using a large branded food bag when you leave the house not only helps you carry your purchases but can also help you use public bathrooms without being harassed by staff when doing so. Carrying such a bag sends a signal to any potential questioners that you are likely a delivery person and therefore have a legitimate reason to be anywhere you are at any time, making it less likely you'll be bothered for merely using the facilities."

super glue is decent glue but it won work in all situations without diving too much into the theory behind it here quick question to ask yourself before fixing something with super glue did this break during normal use if the answer is yes don try fixing it with super glue for example say you had container with handle if one day you lifted the container by the handle one too many times and the handle snapped off don use super glue to reattach the handle however if you re carrying the container and you hit it against something and the corner chips off you could glue the corner back and have reasonably good chance of the repair holding up super glue isn as strong as the name implies it generally leaves whatever you fixed weaker than it was originally and it not good for sustained stress if you re fixing something that broke under normal level of stress like the handle in the above example that same normal stress will break super glue almost instantly either use epoxy add something that will reinforce the handle and add mass and strength to it or replace the handle entirely but if the repair isn expected to normally take lot of weight or stress like something that broke under an unexpected blow then super glue might hold up better there generally something better than super glue for repairs but it has its uses and it seems like it always around it easier to keep tube of super glue around than epoxy that needs new mixing tip every time you use it but know its limitations and you ll be less likely to have to repair something twice,"Super glue can be a good solution for repairing some broken items, but it is not always the best choice. Before using super glue to fix something, it is important to consider whether the break was due to normal use, as super glue is not designed to withstand sustained stress or heavy loads. In cases where a repair is likely to encounter high levels of stress or strain, super glue may not be strong enough and a more durable fix, such as epoxy or a replacement part, may be necessary. Additionally, super glue can weaken the integrity of the original material, making it more prone to future breaks. Understanding the limitations of super glue can help ensure more successful repairs."

Here are some tips: 

1. Consider catering options or prepare large batch recipes you can make in advance for ease of serving on the day.

3. Use chafing dishes to keep food warm throughout your event. Purchase fuel cans for heat and place dishes over them. Alternatively, you can use a hot box or slow cooker to keep food warm. 

4. Ensure you have adequate ice for coolers and use serving utensils to avoid cross-contamination of foods. 

5. Plan your menu ahead of time to avoid stress and prep what you can before your event. 

Remember to have fun and enjoy your event!"

retired now but worked in silicon valley for years here are couple of things that found is useful in landing job at startup my observations also apply to people who are not engineers what this is about is finding out where smart money goes and following it first find out who the venture capital firms are that back the kind of companies you re looking for frequently vc firms will specialize in particular areas like biotech for example much googlation will be necessary once you ve figured out which vc firm you want go visit their website in virtually all cases they will have portfolio of the companies they are backing take note of the companies and of course their websites visit the company websites and go to the careers area have look at the kind of jobs they re offering the rest is up to you remember the tricky thing about startups is almost all of them fail so beware by using this approach you can be sure that at least someone with money and supposedly business sense has thought it good idea to invest in them good luck,"If you are looking to get a job at a startup, a good place to look would be the venture capital (VC) firms that fund startups. Look at the types of companies that the VC firms invest in and investigate if they are the type of company you'd like to work for. Chances are if a VC firm decided to invest in a company, they think they will at least be moderately successful and you'll want to get in on the ground floor of that success."
it has always been difficult for me to fall asleep even when im tired because my brain refuses to switch off listening to good podcast or lecture makes me immediately fall asleep because my mind stops jumping around to random ideas and anxious thoughts it has been really helpful to me because have been getting hours of sleep for the last whole week and good early night sleep is real game changer for me,Listening to podcasts or lectures helps you fall asleep easily and prevents you from waking up at night because it prevents your mind from wandering to anxious thoughts.

people absolutely love to self diagnose oh it just sinus infection oh it just some mold inhaled oh it my lumbago they ll get you sick keep your distance also do not go around people if you re feeling under the weather unless you have an actual diagnosis it very rude,"It is irritating and impolite when people self-diagnose themselves with imaginary illnesses and then broadcast their ""diagnosis"" to others, urging them to stay away. Unless you have had symptoms evaluated by a qualified professional, refrain from advising others to isolate or behave differently due to your speculative diagnosis."
it turning towards freezing in my area and it popped into my head the other night that needed to disconnect our exterior hoses from the house doing this is critical to allow the frost free hose bibs to drain and prevent freezing damage was actually pretty surprised at just how much water came out of each bib when removed the hoses found this company tech note which demonstrates the issue,"It's getting cold where you live, so you remember to disconnect your exterior hoses from the house to allow the frost-free hose bibs to drain to prevent freezing damage. There's a demonstration from a company that shows just how much water comes out of the hose bib when you remove the hoses."
there are in most key systems two ways to make hotel room key cards you can create key which is what done when you check in and that wipes all previous guest keys from the lock either at the moment of creation for online locks or when you first use them for offline locks you can alternatively duplicate keys which just creates copy of the original key that lock treats as the same if you get duplicate key whoever finds your old keys can still use them to access the room if they have way to figure out which room they go to if you get re created key then all the existing guest keys stop working yes this may annoy people you re traveling with but it the safer route the reason key duplicates exist is purely for guest convenience it so if one person forgets their room key everybody does not have to get new room keys but it big security risk for lost keys also make sure you engage the deadbolt switch some locks have separate deadbolt lever some do it by turning the door handle straight up this will typically disable all keys including most staff keys except for security emergency keys it not always physical deadbolt but it still works like one night latches the bar things if you re staying somewhere that still has them will make you feel better but do not offer much security side channel physical security devices like the velco strap that wraps around the handle deadbolt or dead bolting night latching and stuffing towels around each to prevent under door tools will increase your security so if you re traveling with highly sensitive information like electronic devices with highly sensitive information or potentially dangerous things like firearm they may be worth the trade off of denying emergency access how you weigh them is up to you if you do have special security needs talking to the hotel ahead of time can mitigate lot of those tradeoffs anyways stay safe avoid dangerous people and places never defend property and if confronted act decisively and escape edit forgot to say if you do lose your room key it usually not possible or it should not be possible to tell which room in hotel that key goes to some hotels do encode the room number into the key with some proprietary system but it still just encoded so not secure just hopefully secret so they can identify keys later it the the room number that encoded with some proprietary whatnots the actual information to that opens the door is encrypted which is different thing hopefully and well designed systems will identify wandering intruders and deactivate key entirely if it used on more than usually wrong doors so you cannot just keep walking down hallways to find out where it works,"There are two ways that hotel room keys can be made. You can have a key created, which wipes all previous guest keys from the lock, or you can get a duplicate key. Duplicate keys create a copy of the original key that the lock treats as the same. Neither option is better than the other, it is more a matter of guest convenience. 

If you lose your key, there is no need to worry because it should not be possible to tell which room the key goes to. Overall, hotel key systems are designed to keep guests safe."

my take is there are four categories of stuff stuff that means something to you keep stuff that means something to someone else mostly toss donate stuff that has monetary value sell stuff that is still useful mostly keep anything that has sentimental value to you personally old toys heirlooms photos is stuff you should keep but bear in mind that most of that stuff becomes with the next generation stuff that meant something to someone else but does not really mean much to you is good candidate for tossing donating most of your parents or grandparents furniture probably belongs in this category same thing with most kitchenware and some clothing souvenirs from trips and knick knacks probably belong here as well in some cases there is stuff that has real monetary value and would be worthwhile to sell properly some antiques jewelry paintings etc anything that can be sold at garage sale for or less may not be worth the hassle and finally anything you inherit that is still useful should be kept the most obvious example are tools and some household items simple stuff like brooms laundry baskets etc these things really have an unlimited life as long as they do not break and can still serve valuable purpose for anyone interested there was an article in today wall street journal that addressed this topic agree with the reporter claim that today generation has less of an attachment to physical items than previous generation which makes this more complicated,"Keeping the possessions that mean something to you and selling or giving away things that no longer hold value to you is a sensible way to approach decluttering. Sentimental items, antiques, jewelry, and other valuables can be sold for a good price. However, there are some items, such as kitchenware, clothing, and furniture that may have been valuable to someone else but don't necessarily have the same worth for you, and it would be wise to donate or toss them."
add any tag onto your gmail username with tagname it will still send to your email but allows you to create filter that sends messages where you want them also periods do not matter in gmail so if you have firstnamelastname com mailto firstnamelastname com you also have firstname lastname com mailto firstname lastname com and com mailto com but not after com that just the end of the sentence edit email marketing software often removes the suffix from emails so it not as useful as thought,"You can add a tag to the end of your Gmail address and still receive emails, and Gmail ignores periods, so tags can be appended in various ways for filtering purposes. This is useful as some email marketing software removes suffixes."
this only works occasionally but if you re buying something very expensive it might be worth it some vendors include coupon for off your next order when they ship your order if you need to buy something expensive and the vendor also sells some cheap lightweight item that you use order the cheap one first and maybe you ll get coupon that you can apply to the expensive item of course this works only if you can also afford the delay and are willing to take chance on paying the shipping on the cheaper item,"Some vendors will include coupons for money off your next order when they ship your purchase. One way to possibly obtain such a coupon is to order a cheap, lightweight item from them first, hoping that they will include a coupon for the more expensive item you really want. This is assuming you can afford to wait and don't mind paying separate shipping costs."
always had trouble remembering to take my birth control pill recently moved my dog treat jar next to the drawer keep my pills in so without really thinking started giving my dog treat everytime take it now my dog know the exact time supposed to give him his daily treat and will not stop following me until give it to him thanks to him do not forget to take my pill anymore he the goodest boy,Moving my dog's treat jar to be next to my birth control pill container has resulted in me giving my dog a treat every time I take my pill.

it should be obvious but found out not long ago bought some shirts that where hang dry but had nowhere to dry them live in the tropics rains can happen at any time so hanged them in the bathroom curtain and put dehumidifier inside and lock the door couple of hours later the shirts where crispy dry since then basically dry all delicate clothes this way it even works in room if you buy an dehumidifier you can dry clothes pretty much anywhere even inside an apartment or where it constantly rains,"If you lack space to dry your hang-dry only clothing, you can use a dehumidifier in a small room or bathroom, or even in a large closet, to remove excess moisture from the air and dry your clothing quickly. This is an excellent solution for humid climates or during rainy seasons."
have found this tip elsewhere but figured share for anyone who hasn bothered looking up how to fix it have only tested it with firefox but imagine any non chromium browsers will work as well edit useful information per mrfurebss open your browser and go to the firefox add ons page search for the adblock plus add on and install it once installed open the settings and click the enabled option reload youtube and you should no longer see the freezing issue edit more useful information per accomplishedpipe note you may need to disable adblock for youtube in the settings if you still see freezing or other issues,"To stop YouTube from freezing on Firefox, install the Adblock Plus add-on, enable it, and then disable it for YouTube if necessary. This blocks the ads that cause freezing. Note that this only applies to Firefox and probably other browsers that are not Chromium-based."
this way you get few coupons freebies every month instead of just on your birthday for example my starbucks account says my birthday is in september but my panera account says it in october note this won work on stores that require your id to use with the coupon some restaurants do that like think olive garden might be one,"Some restaurants, like Starbucks, will give you coupons for free items monthly instead of just on your birthday. This works best for restaurants that don't require ID to use the coupons, since you can set your birthday to be any day in the month you choose."
do not know if it the air pockets created by piling clothes on top of each other but this is much warmer than adding another blanket if your feet get cold then pile your clothes over where your feet will go more clothes makes your warmer also it also gives comforting weighted blanket effect without making your feel trapped or limiting your motion edit you only need articles of clothing for this to work it handy in pinch it also feels very nice test it out yourself stay warm out there,"If you're feeling cold at night, try layering clothes instead of using another blanket. Clothes trap air better than blankets, and piling clothes near your feet or anywhere you feel cold can help you stay warm. Experiment with this method and see if it works for you."
just as the title states use credit card gift card such as visa in place of real credit card the card doesn even have to have money on it it only needs to have valid card number expiration and cvv this method stops you from being charged when you forget to cancel free trials you can also use it to cancel automatic payments when you switch the payment card to the gift card,"You can use a prepaid Visa gift card to replace a credit card when it comes to free trials or subscriptions that you need to cancel. Just make sure that the gift card has a valid card number, expiration date, and CVV. This method prevents you from being charged when you forget to cancel a free trial."
now that we re in the thick of fall here lpt that will help you cut down on the number of yard waste bags you re using gather up your leaves twigs whatever stuff it all in large trash can or any sturdy vessel hold up sledgehammer vertically over your canned yard waste and smash that it takes almost no additional time or effort but compacts everything down to about quarter of the volume it would have been otherwise you could also dump the contents back out spread em around and mulch your yard edit these comments are pretty telling of who has lots of mature trees in around their yard and who does not or has no yard lol,"Instead of bagging your yard waste, try putting it in a trash can and smashing it down with a sledgehammer. This will compact the leaves and twigs down, reducing the volume by a quarter. This method requires little effort and saves you time, bags, and possibly money."
found that have great conversations with people at parties but even though we exchanged numbers never really know how to follow up and turn it into friendship asking for recommendation during the conversation and then following up after has worked really well for me benefits here in the moment when you ask people love talking about themselves and they appreciate the opportunity to share something that brought them joy or meaning the followup can literally happen anytime days or even weeks after just if it been while you might have to jog their memory bit most important imo you taking their recommendation makes them feel heard remembered and taken seriously it provides the perfect topic for future conversation in sharing thoughts and opinions at the very least you could get some pretty good content out of this lot of my favorite songs have been random recommendations from people this of course will not work all the time and friendships require more than just one piece of content in common to sustain them but ve found this is good way to get the ball rolling,"Having great conversations with new people at parties is easy, but turning these acquaintances into friends can be tricky. Asking them for recommendations during your conversation and then following up later is an effective way to keep the dialogue going. People love talking about themselves and sharing things they love, and taking their advice makes them feel acknowledged and respected. While sharing recommendations may not alone build a lasting friendship, it is a great way to create a foundation for future conversations and foster potential friendships."

large greens that you get in bunch like kale and chard you should cut small portion of the ends off and then wrap wet paper towel around the end and rubber band it before putting in fridge if they begin to wilt pull them out and submerge the end in water bath for hours and make sure the leaves get some water too unless they re completely gone they will puff right back up and become firm just like when you bought them cilantro and basil should be washed and the stem placed in cup with some water and plastic bag over the leaves to keep the moisture in bunch will stay good in the fridge for many weeks change the water every few days when saving cut apple pear or similar fruit squeeze bit of lemon or lime juice on the flesh and store in an airtight container it will save in the fridge for several days without browning berries should be washed in homemade vinegar washbath with cups water and tablespoons acv and dried well and stored in an breathable container in the fridge not the coldest spot as soon as you spot berries bananas and other non citrus fruit starting to spoil put them in mason jar in your freezer to keep for pancakes smoothies sauces etc save your scraps for broth if you cook with onions garlic carrots celery tomato and fresh herbs save all of the ends tops and wasted bits to make veggie broth get ideally half gallon contain for your freezer and set aside scraps when chopping and freeze windfall pull out scraps and boil in big soup pot for to hours with some salt and strain this broth is fantastic for cooking beans rice and soups instead of buying expensive store bought broth but skip the brassica family they generally do not fare well in broth cabbage broccoli cauliflower kale do you have economical food tips to help you more out of what you buy at the store throw them in the comments,"To make sure your greens last as long as possible, cut off the ends and wrap them in a wet paper towel before storing them in the fridge.

this may be obvious to some but young and just recently figured this out in the stage of my life where slowly starting to see my friends less and less because of work and girlfriends wives at first it really upset me and it felt like it was me vs the significant other but that terrible way of thinking and the way to kill your friendship the quickest then figured out that if the so likes me then it way easier to hang out with my friend now constantly hear friend bitching about never being able to see friend that they re whipped yadda yadda while ve been hanging out with them this entire time and made some new friends to boot obviously keep it respectful and don overstep any boundaries just feel like it could help some young people feel little less alone in this period of transition,"Sometimes it can be difficult when our friends start spending more time with their significant others. We may feel left out or like we're competing with their partner for their friendship. However, it's important to remember that if their partner likes us too, we can use this as an opportunity to spend more time with our friend and even make new friends. As long as we're respectful, we can maintain our friendship and even grow it."
kinda hard to drive away forgetting something you sat on the car if it is staring you in the face once your in the seat seems like no brainer but based on how often see something on someone roof as they pull out of parking spot or starting to drive down the road it seems not everyone realizes there is better alternative,"It can be easy to forget something that you sat on your car when you go to drive away, especially if it is something large that is staring you right in the face.

have lots of experience working in call center environment both as an agent and as quality assurance and compliance manager in my career have been fly on the wall in thousands if not tens of thousands of phone calls to an endless variety of entities both personal and professional in single shift may observe more phone calls than the average american makes in single year have learned lot along the way but there is not really mechanism to share that learning with the public so thought might share here in the hopes this is seen by folks who might benefit from it here goes making an outgoing call be prepared if you are calling anywhere where you need to get something done make sure you have the tools you need to complete the transaction before you dial the number ordering lunch you should have your lunch order ready write it down if you need to having the order taker on the line is not the time you should start asking your boyfriend what he wants to order or what your kids want to drink most restaurants are taking multiple calls at time and need to get place and prepare your order quickly so they can move onto the next customer it extremely irritating and pretty disrespectful to call into busy chinese restaurant and pizza place who is putting multiple callers on hold while you poll all of your friends in the room about what they want to order your goal should be to be as quick and efficient as possible so do not call until you have what you want ready to go paying credit card bill or checking your account balance have your payment or account information ready they are going to ask you for card number the last of card number or the last of your social have these items in hand before you place the call give me one second while run to my car to grab my debit card should never be something you need to say to telephone agent prepare for the identity verification process do your due diligence to keep your information up to date security protocols are in place to help ensure that your data is kept safe from unauthorized users do not get mad at your call rep for asking what your verbal passcode is or asking you to verify your identity with one time code if you find these processes annoying research them and figure out what they are intended to do do not go off on your agent who is just doing their job to keep your account secure receiving an incoming call be skeptical it true legitimate parties can call you and ask you for your personal information credit card fraud departments for example may legitimately autodial you to verify suspicious activity just as often though there are nefarious actors trying to steal your information or scam you out of money remember best practice if familiar financial institution reaches out to you asking for any personal information verify the last of your social security number etc just let them know you will reach back out hang up and dial the number found on the back of your credit debit card or on one of your official bills statements if there is legitimately an issue that needs resolving the representative will be able to pull it up and help you address it you may be surprised however to find that there is actually no issue at all and that you were likely in the hands of scammer who said enough to convince you to give them personal information listen closely if receiving call it is important to know that medicare inc or medicare services agency etc are not actually affiliated with medicare america bank is not the same as bank of america many scammers will purposely pick similar sounding names because it confuses people it takes just one person to fall for the trick to potentially rake in thousands of dollars this is why the best practice above is your friend never give one time code to someone especially if the request is coming from someone via text or email but even if you receive phone call asking for one time passcode that was texted to you never give out the code as it could be the last step in accessing and subsequently draining your accounts the only exception if you have placed call not received call to trusted organization and the representative initiates one time code being sent to you to verify your identity beyond that never ever share your one time codes never ever ever ever share password if it sounds too good to be true it is no one wins free trips through the phone it is almost impossible to win publisher clearing house grand prize and you would not be notified via random phone call and no one is going to give you any money for free not dollar much less or no celebrity is going to reach out to you so if you get messenger request from one ignore it you do not need to engage with the scammer to verify if it fake or legit just ignore them block them do no interact with them scammers will do anything to get money from you including lying cheating and emotionally manipulating you emotional manipulation includes making you feel sad or afraid your second

you so much you are my girlfriend boyfriend helpful please support the wounded veterans charity helping american soldiers overseas who need to be rescued from dangerous operations in short be wary of anyone asking you for payment of any kind gift cards cash western union zelle money transfers cashapp apple cash etc disconnect and call back the entity requesting money from an official number of theirs be it your bank your supposed cousin in jail in nigeria or publisher clearing house also tbh publisher clearing house is trash and not worth your time and energy unless you just enjoy life filled with false hope speak clearly personally appreciate the diversity of dialects accents and regional or personal features present in our languages you do not need to change your accent to make call but do be mindful that there is difference between talking to representative some of whom are based overseas speaking to you for the first time and talking to your parent or sibling who have known you all your life regardless of your accent it is important to speak clearly it is also good idea to stay very close to the receiver if you must be on speakerphone speakerphone is not designed for you to sit it on your kitchen table and walk to the living room while chatting from afar ending your call the absolute simplest when you re done with call manually disconnect your call click the end call button and verify that the call has ended just because you hear the other line go silent does not mean the caller has hung up you may think the call has really ended but you can still be heard talking to your relatives about what happened on the call talking about totally unrelated things etc there are countless times have been able to listen to people complain about the agent they just worked with not realizing that we are unable to end the call and have to for some amount of time at least wait for them to disconnect the call themselves this is much much much more common than you think especially but not at all limited to people making calls via their car bluetooth connection end your calls do not assume the other person has trust your gut common sense can only get us so far in world where technology is outpacing our ability to always keep up with it but it important to think critically why would my bank text me or send me message on whatsapp why would taylor swift message me on facebook why would the irs use curse word or threaten me with jail when have never received any written correspondence suggesting there was an issue if you have single doubt or something just feels funny or especially if you notice your emotions are becoming more intense confusion panic fear sadness etc just hang up the phone you can take time to collect yourself think through what is going on and figure out what legitimate contact person is the best to follow up with to clarify what is going on and be wary of any representative who immediately answers the phone when you call back legitimate organizations have professional sounding push for english push for spanish type automatic answerers that clearly state the name of the organization you re calling if you re allegedly calling microsoft or your hospital billing department but when you call you just hear music or silence then random representative answers hang up the phone for some all of this will be painfully obvious but every year phone scams account for approx us billion in losses for the victims of scammers these victims are not just dumb but are actually victims of people who will do anything and everything to lower your defenses take advantage of you and manipulate you toward the goal of stealing your data and or money if in doubt hang up the phone call trusted number to verify that the request is truthful and or lean on trusted savvy loved one to help you navigate the process if you re feeling very overwhelmed or confused it always better to hang up and maybe hurt legitimate

before you make a call to customer service. 

Be wary of incoming calls and ask for a way to verify the identity of the person on the other end, such as a one-time passcode sent to your phone number or an account number you can find on your latest bill. 

Do not give out personal information to strangers who call you. 

Always hang up if you feel that something is off, and call back a number you find independently, such as on the back of your credit card.

End the call manually to ensure it's disconnected, and do not discuss personal details once you've ended the call."
there is no need to find therapists in the same state or country you live in this is specially true if you live in country like the us where they are prohibitively expensive and only those with money can afford to see one look in other countries that have cheaper currency exchange rates unlike the us most do not restrict where they are allowed to practice even better if you can speak more than language just look for those that accept credit card payments and can do sessions via video you do get what you pay for but for most people therapy is not even financial option,"There is no need to look for therapists in your state or country, especially if you live in the US, due to expense. Look in other countries with lower currency exchange rates and where therapists are not restricted to practicing within their borders. Ideally, you can also speak more than one language and pay via credit card for sessions via video."
this is based on my experience with netflix the cost of netflix has basically doubled in last years and there are many months where do not use it and switch with other streaming services so instead of having continuous membership basically subscribe it for month and immediately cancel it within next few minutes since have subscribed and paid can still use it for the rest of the month so there are two possibilities at the end of the paid month you want to continue watching it in this case it is only click to renew your netflix subscription and netflix basically maintains your history as well so all you need is one additional click at the end of the paid month you are no longer using netflix because you are watching something else in that case netflix subscription is cancelled and you save all the subscription cost till you use it again this is based on my personal experience and it can definitely vary for others based on their usage save close to year by following this tip across streaming services edit thanks everyone for sharing your opinions do see lot of them suggesting piracy even though the corporations are charging lot of money for subscriptions all the content we watch and pay for indirectly goes to the numerous artists technicians who put it in the effort to sustain their daily life just my opinion that instead of going into piracy we can minimize and pay just for the amount that we use,"The price of Netflix has significantly increased over the past few years. Many subscribers have noticed they don't stream content monthly as they used to. Instead of paying for a continuous subscription, some users subscribe for a month, watch the content they intended to, and then cancel their subscription before the next payment cycle. This way, they still get to watch their show or movie while saving money on the subscription costs. 
This is based on my personal experience, and others may have different perspectives on how to save on streaming services. Some suggest piracy, but I believe in supporting the artists and technicians who create the content by paying for what we use.  We can still save money by only paying for what we watch instead of subscribing to multiple services continuously. 
Edit: Thanks to everyone for sharing their ideas. I have noticed many suggestions about piracy, which is not legal. All the content we pay for goes to the artists and technicians who put effort into creating it.  I suggest we pay for what we consume rather than turn to piracy. 

Netflix doubled their prices in recent years and aware many subscribers don't utilize their subscription monthly. Some subscribers have found a workaround to save on their subscription costs."
recently got covid and my mom and went to get doctor note for my school the doctor told us that had some earwax in my ear too they told us some medication called debrox to try for it and when we tried it some of it was dropped into my ear and what it was supposed to do is break the wax up which it may have done but it also feels like it pushed the wax into my ear more the first time we did it it felt weird but could still hear decently from my right ear and my left ear was little worse the next time we tried it the same thing but when went to bed that night and woke up my right ear was just like the left and now could not hear well from either when rinse my ear with rubber bulb little bit of ear wax comes out my hearing is the same or worse as if the wax that got pushed further into my ear just hardened and now is stuck we have been using this medicine everyday and it feels like my hearing is getting worse maybe not being able to hear clearly is getting to me but my mom seems insistent that it will work she says that everything she has read says the symptoms may get worse until it eventually falls out should we keep using the debrox,"You indicate that you dropped some Debrox into your ear after being instructed by a doctor to use it to break up ear wax. Unfortunately, it appears that the drops may have had the opposite effect, and your ear wax may have been pushed further into your ear canal causing a decrease in your hearing. It is possible that your ear wax may have hardened and become impacted, causing your symptoms. It is important to note that there are other methods to remove ear wax that may be safer and more effective.

source video from either iii motor rifles or the azov battalion and the medics were talking about how lot of guys who had relatively minor wounds or even treatable major limb bleeds would lose their limbs unnecessarily in essence when you start bleeding heavily you tourniquet the limb to prevent blood loss this is good however what was happening is guys were getting hit in the arm or leg and on the battlefield their buddies would tie off the limb to stop them bleeding out this is good now it seems like common sense that wrapping cord around any part of your body and cutting off blood flow kills the limb but obviously the official advice when heavily bleeding is to do just that obviously if someone is bleeding heavily it case of better safe than sorry and tie it off what they found was that soldiers were receiving relatively minor wounds they had the limb tied off just to be safe because they seemed fine they waited for they be left waiting hours for evacuation by this point the tied off limb has died and numb and needs to be amputated because if they untie it toxic dead infected blood from necrotic limb rushing back into their bodies which can kill you the advice they received from the field hospital teams was that after hours the tourniquet needs to come off otherwise the limb will die am not doctor so it is hard to say on case by case risk reward basis if you leave the shattered limb slit wrists if you find someone who done the forever sleep thing farm accident on the battlefield wherever the tourniquet is temporary tool it saves lives by cutting off limbs but my point is just because they or you are stable with tied off limb you still need to urgently do what you can to get proper treatment do not be afraid of using tourniquet but just especially if you re out on farm or the hunting in the woods or whatever recognise that the tourniquet buys you time once the limb has died you ll lose it either way do not remove it if the limb looks quite obviously dead or if it has been too long bonus story yeah slit my wrist when was and did good job of it going down the wrist why because had pocket knife and stick and wanted to peel the bark off it to make bow and arrow so with my left hand gripped the stick to steady the stick braced it along my arm and up under the crook of my elbow sure you can see where this is going anyway at some point went to shave more off the stick and the pocket knife slipped started somewhere up the top of my lower arm and came out above my wrist the blood my god the amount of blood it was spurting up and onto the ceiling although this was not helped by my year old survival mechanism which consisted of waving my cut arm around frantically and screaming muuuuuuuuuum in retrospect how came away from that with no real injuries to my tendons or what not is astounding but yeah tourniquets seem like hypotheticals until they are not haha,"Soldiers would unnecessarily amputate limbs because they were told to tie off limbs that were bleeding heavily on the battlefield, even if the wound was minor or treatable. This is because the risk of untying the tourniquet is that dead tissue can enter the bloodstream and cause death. It is better to save a life by temporarily cutting off blood flow to a limb, but amputation is irreversible, so it is important to seek proper treatment as soon as possible.

However, when you do get together with your friends, you have a great time and are glad to have them in your life. 

Maintaining adult friendships takes effort, but the reward is worth it."
if you re like me nervousness around flying largely comes from feeling very out of control of the situation one thing ve found that puts me little more at ease is listening to liveatc feeds for the airport flying out of the professionalism and honestly sometimes near boredom of controllers and pilots on the radio inspire great confidence in their ability to safely deliver me from point to point plus it makes me feel more involved in the process and more clued in to what is going on which soothes my inner control freak if you re one of those people who would rather not know what going on and instead leave it up to the pros obviously this is not for you,Listening to live air traffic control (ATC) feeds from the airport helps calm nervousness around flying for people who feel better when they are more in control of a situation.

if you re unlucky enough to be in store with delayed egress doors they will require you to hold the bar for around seconds then wait about seconds before the door unlocks all while sounding localized alarm at the door specifically designed to bring attention to the door for staff to intercept shoplifters or trespassers you can try pulling the fire alarm to override this system but this would also cause everyone else in the building who is unaware of the shooter to stream out into the hallways potentially putting much more people at risk make sure that the emergency door you found has no alarm linked to it if so you may be better off hunkering down and laying low edit sure that these doors are legally required to have sign explicitly saying that an alarm will be triggered if these doors are opened so that the type of stuff to look out for,"If you find yourself in a store with delayed egress doors, you will need to hold the bar for approximately 10 seconds, followed by a further 10 second wait before the door unlocks. This delay is accompanied by an alarm to draw staff attention to potential shoplifters or trespassers. However, this can also prove hazardous in the event of an active shooter situation. 

It is advisable to search for an emergency door without an alarm link and lay low if possible, unless there is a sign stating the door will trigger an alarm upon opening."

is there anything that helps you deal with or even get over anxiety there are few things that have helped me recently talking to friend about my issues and secondly trying to be myself as best can tend to get overly anxious about what people think of me and then obsess about what could say or if saying too much or overstepping just an emotionally sensitive person tbh thanks,"Speaking to friends about anxiety issues can really help, as can focusing on just being oneself without worrying too much about what others think about you.

my current job went full time in office and it is killing me between the commute and the office just being overall uncomfortable am currently job hunting and am worried that if take hybrid position the new job will stab me in the back in the future is there anything should look for in job listing ask in interviews or reasonably request in an offer letter to reduce the risk of my next job pulling stunt like my current employer,"You are uncomfortable with your current job requiring you to be in the office full time and want to hunt for a more flexible position, but you are worried that your new job might also go full in-office in the future. 

To reduce the risk of this happening again you can: 

1. Look for job listings that have flexible working options written in them somewhere, preferably in the benefits section, to indicate that remote work is a perk they offer and not just a temporary measure. 

2. Ask in the interview what their long-term plans are regarding remote work and how they determine which positions are in-office, hybrid, or fully remote. This will give you an idea of whether the company is receptive to flexible working arrangements and whether they have a clear policy regarding this.

3. Reasonably request in your offer letter that the position be kept hybrid or remote permanently and that they have a plan to accommodate this. 

4. Look for news articles or company reviews from employees talking about remote work policies, as this might indicate whether the company is serious about permanent flexible working options or if they are just using it as a perk to get people in the door."

For example, it might randomly alternate between ""of"", ""if"", ""on"", ""an"", and other words beginning with those letters, instead of correctly predicting the word you want based on what you've typed so far. 

The narrator would like to know if there's a way to set letter limits to prevent autocorrect from suggesting inappropriate words."

am constantly amazed how often customer service comes through for me and saves me money just by calling and asking nicely if they can help it not sure fire result every time sometimes there nothing they will do but more often then not am offered free replacement part discount coupon to replace an item or refund after warranty expires my brita faucet mount filter cracked so before ran out to get new one called to ask if there was anything they could do they sent me new one in the mail paid in advance for parking at my local airport and accidentally put in the wrong dates didn realize until today when they emailed to thank me for my stay figured had just wasted for dumb mistake but before beat myself up entirely decided to call their customer service to see if they could possibly apply my payment to the dates intended to book or perhaps discount was kind and admitted it was my mistake but thought would at least ask he was very nice on the phone and said he could confirm in the system if my license plate didn ever enter the parking garage and if it didn which it hadn since booked the wrong dates he would refund me sure many people will comment on how this was my fault to begin with and lpt pay attention when booking things which is also good lpt haha had booked it while distracted on big job at work mistakes happen but overall my point is if you can stomach phone calls to strangers and are nice they will usually help you out it good for business they want the customer to be happy,"Customer service can be surprisingly helpful if you just ask. Calling politely to ask for a favor, a replacement part, or a refund can work more often than not. In the case described, the customer accidentally booked the wrong dates for airport parking and called to ask if the payment could be applied to the correct dates or for a discount.

background worked as constituent service intern not so long ago and learned what we can actually do for the citizens in our area as it turns out there is lot some examples free septa pass for senior citizens above certain age that will allow folks to ride public tranportation or trains within the state for free get discount on out of state trains senior citizens who are low income can also get non profit job where your wage is payed for by the government and the work is part time if the government needs forum to provide services it is generally true that they are knowledgable and qualified to submit them for you and help you fill them out for instance during the covid lockdowns people needed to submit various forums for things like unemployment or medicare but the departments were under staffed and unable to help people so my state senators office helped people submit the forums more programs are avalible then you think and they may not have heard about all of them but generally they will be able to help in situations where other parts of the government cannot they can also answer your questions about the agenda of your state and whose doing what that is all part of their job last thing to note is some services require these people so they can be essential for instance the septa pass for seniors needs photo they will take that and fill out your information,"Constituent services interns help citizens discover services they may qualify for, such as free SEPTA passes for senior citizens, out-of-state train discounts, non-profit jobs for low-income seniors, and assistance with government forms. During the COVID-lockdowns, many people needed help submitting forms for unemployment or Medicare and couldn't get help because government departments were understaffed. State senators' offices can help citizens discover services and submit forms, answer questions about their state's agenda, and take necessary photographs to help citizens obtain services."
it may seem obvious but perhaps this is not general knowledge because as hotel worker this happens often guest will have problem with their room and will not mention it until they are leaving or long after they have left at that point it too late for us to do anything but if you mention it to the staff as soon as you discover problem we will probably be able to help you rectify it now of course there are some things that are out of our control but the vast majority of complaints hear after the fact are so fixable things like an appliance was not working they were out of toiletries they needed extra bedding we can switch your busted hair dryer for new one we can get you replacement soap or more bedding even if it something more serious like housekeeper missed spot the ac unit is on the fritz or neighbor is blasting loud music we can often send someone to fix the issue get you moved to different room enforce quiet hours etc in an ideal world all hotel rooms would be perfect every time but unfortunately reality does not always go to plan people are human things break down and really the only way we know is if someone tells us the unruly children running up and down the th floor hallway may be keeping you up but cannot hear them from the desk on the ground floor lobby let us know the fact that your room iron died halfway through your stay is super frustrating get it but we are not telepathically linked to you or your room appliances let us know it really disheartening to staff to only hear about how horrible your stay was at check out when nothing we can do about it now or even worse finding out through negative google review or similar and there no need for you to suffer either or stew in building anger and resentment over some issue that impacting the quality of your stay most things can be fixed replaced or otherwise addressed and if it cannot we can often compensate for the inconvenience in some way at the very least but only if you tell us tl dr we cannot fix problem we do not know about let us help you,"Guests often don't notify staff of problems with their hotel room until checkout, at which point it's too late for the hotel to fix the issue. In order to provide the best service possible, employees request that guests notify staff of any problems, no matter how small, in order to allow for fixes, replacements, and other accommodations to be made. Guests benefit from this as well, through compensation and a higher quality of stay."

However, it is important to note that excessively blowing on the burner can result in a dangerous flame surge, so gentle ventilation is key. It is always better to identify the root issue causing the weak flame and resolve it accordingly."

have tried the custom mouthguard based on my own teeth impression with peroxide and unfortunately it seems that am out of luck because my teeth are either naturally yellow in color or my enamel is gone making the yellow color permanent because my teeth color did not get brighter at all also tried crest otc whitestrips twice and both times failed and yes did make sure to have deep clean from my dentist before doing the whitening should essentially give up on having white teeth and bright smile also my dentist was telling me that higher percentage hydrogen peroxide in teeth whitening gel does not necessarily whiten better it just works faster asked him if should dry the peroxide instead of the am currently on and thats what he told me using lower concentration gel for longer duration for hours can achieve similar levels of whitening as brief application of high concentration gel for mins over extended periods both concentrations will likely reach similar maximal whitening levels the higher percentage product just gets there faster is that true guys should give up on whitening,"They have tried a custom mouthguard with peroxide, Crest whitestrips, and talked with their dentist, but their teeth are still yellow.

just started the process to switch my carrier from verizon to another major carrier in order to port my phone number to the new carrier you have to request number transfer pin which acts as two factor authorization to move your number as soon as completely the request received text from verizon granting me off per line on my account for being loyal customer it last ditch attempt to keep customers from leaving and will save you mo per line for months if it works for you here how to request the number transfer pin pin is not the same as canceling or moving your line this is just the pin you need if you were going to move your line the pin itself expires after about week,"If you want to switch carriers and take your phone number with you, you'll need to request a number transfer PIN from your current carrier (Verizon, in this case). This is a short-term PIN that expires after about a week, and it's used to authenticate and authorize number transfers between carriers. Keep in mind that requesting the PIN does not cancel or move your line; it simply allows you to take your number to a different carrier. If you're considering making a switch, check with your current carrier to see if they offer any discounts or incentives for loyal customers like Verizon's retention offer."

before you start arguing with me in the comments hear me out all my life ve been chronic overthinker even making the simplest decisions like what want to eat at restaurant is agonizingly painful for me any time think ve settled on the option want start overthinking my decision and wonder if it right it like an endless cycle that can get out of this is where the random choice picker comes in you enter in the options spin the wheel and let it pick for you when the result comes up you ll have an instant gut reaction are you disappointed in the result or relieved that the generator picked that option if you re disappointed pick the other option while if you re relieved pick that option there decision made the reason that this works is because most of the time when you re making decision you already have gut instinct of which option you want to choose but you re too scared to verbalize it in case it the wrong decision so you overthink it instead of just choosing that option however by using the random choice picker your reaction to the result is instant and you don have time to think about it this means that you ll instinctively feel happy if it comes up with the choice you subconsciously want it to or disappointed if it anything else now as fair warning maybe don use this method for extremely important decisions but ve found that in general it works pretty well in helping me know what decision actually wanted to make all along,"Some people struggle to make even simple decisions due to overthinking. They second-guess their choices and remain in a perpetual state of indecisiveness. This essay proposes using a random choice picker to alleviate this issue. By entering one's options and letting the spinner decide, one can gauge their true feelings about each choice. If you feel relieved or disappointed with the result, you can trust your instincts and select that option. This works because our subconscious already knows what we want, but we hesitate due to fear of failure. This method helps make decisions quicker and with more confidence."

To feel more energetic during the day without depending on caffeine, it is crucial to address your sleep schedule and daily routines to align with your circadian rhythm. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Accept your natural rhythm: Instead of fighting against your body's natural tendency to be more awake at night, accept it and adjust your schedule accordingly. This may involve shifting your workday start time later, if possible, to align with your peak productivity hours.

2. Create a relaxing evening routine: Develop a wind-down routine to prepare your body and mind for sleep. This can include activities such as reading, stretching, listening to relaxing music, or taking a warm bath to help you feel calm and ready for sleep.

3. Practice good sleep hygiene: Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Avoid using your phone or other screen devices an hour before bed. Establish a consistent sleep and wake-up time, even on weekends. These habits promote better quality sleep.

unlike most non latin scripts cyrillic is very similar to latin script shares about one third of characters with it and is very easy to learn to read it took me about three hours to learn it there are multiple websites where you can learn it even wikipedia will suffice script is used for example in bulgaria ukraine russia serbia and central asia slavic languages that use it generally pronounce every character always the same way no matter the position in word originally learned it because of one roadtrip to serbia bulgaria and it paid back many times after being able to read all the signs or reading food names in restaurant if you are not from europe these probably will not be your usual travel destinations but still would say it is cool to know another script might come in handy in some ethnic shops just note aside not all cyrillic characters are used in all cyrillic script languages and there are also regional variations in the character pronunciation also greek script is pretty similar to cyrillic and you can learn it as well while you are at it actually you will probably be able to read greek script after learning cyrillic script,"Learning the Cyrillic script can be beneficial if you're interested in traveling to countries like Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia, Serbia, or parts of Central Asia. BecauseCyrillic shares about a third of its characters with the Latin alphabet, it can be easy to learn, and doing so can help you navigate street signs, restaurant menus, and other written materials.

It would be helpful if you could share what foods you typically eat throughout the day, so I can offer some suggestions specific to your situation. 

In the meantime, here's what you can do: 

1. Continue avoiding salty foods: As you've found, saltiness varies across cuisines and it's wise to continue steering clear of excessively salty foods. 

2. Drink plenty of water: Water helps to flush out excess salt from the body. Drinking enough water is beneficial for general health and can assist with reducing the adverse effects of salt consumption. 

3. Chew on sugar cane: Surprisingly, chewing on sugar cane can help detox your body. It allegedly aids in cleansing the kidneys, though more research is needed to support these claims specifically for salt detoxification.

edit thank you for the tips from those who ve been helpful food addiction is real and when you say delete the app or learn discipline it is incredibly rude and disrespectful to someone who is looking for support idk why you took the energy to make an unhelpful and rude comment rather than express empathy it takes less energy to literally not say anything at all just keep scrolling and mind your business shame on you this happens less than it used to be want it to stop completely it so hard to not indulge when feeling depressed or just tired lazy on fitness journey right now and this is slippery slope order once on saturday and then craving it again midweek my cravings can be bad depending on the time of the month too tried blocking the app on my screen time but it not enough sos,"The person is struggling with a food addiction and finds it difficult to overcome cravings, especially when they are feeling depressed, tired, or it's that time of the month.

if you re like me you ve probably had lots of arguments in your head whether it about conversations or interactions gone wrong or whether it worries about the future or past one way ve found to curb that nonsense is this imagine that you are in circle of fire whatever is outside of the fire are the things you can control accidents the way other people act unexpected events etc whatever is inside the circle are the things you can control the way you respond to stressors your day to day interactions your mindset etc now here is where the fire comes in because the fire is well hot there isn way for you to interact with meaning worry about the things you can control that also means that the things you can control can cross over the fire meaning you are not obligated to worry about them with all that in mind the only thing you can possibly do is to focus on what in the ring of fire the things you can control few disclaimers of course be sure you are clear on what you can control so you don either set yourself up with unrealistic expectations or fall into habit of passivity worrying is absolutely okay under certain contexts and should not be forcibly suppressed such as if you are in immediate danger of being hurt or killed or whatever other kind of life or death scenario or issues that could severely impact your lifestyle that being said it doesn do you any benefit to be worried over things that are less severe than these things this also isn an instantaneous thing that will immediately stop these thoughts it takes lot of practice to fully accept what you can vs what you can control hell it has taken me over year to realize these things anyways this is what works for me and hope it works for you but it completely fine if it doesn,"Here is a strategy for dealing with worries and unwanted thoughts: visualize a circle of fire. Imagine that everything outside the circle is out of your control, including other people's actions and unforeseen events. Everything inside the circle, however, is within your control, such as your reactions to stressors, your interactions with others, and your daily mindset. Focusing on what's inside the circle can help you stop worrying about things you can't control. It's important to understand your abilities and limits and not worry excessively about things that aren't life-or-death matters. This approach takes time and practice to master, but it may be beneficial to you."

this is closer to semi lpt but that sub is underutilized ve worn poly cotton tees to bed for years and have also sweat in bed for years though not every night clearly got the chicken and egg wrong because assumed was warm sleeper and that the synthetic fabric would wick the sweat away from my skin it probably was keeping me dry to some extent but also warming me as well recently switched to all cotton tees and now rarely sweat the winter months will test my hypothesis even more as we switch bedding but not going back to poly cotton kudos if you already knew this did not,For years the poster has worn poly-cotton t-shirts to bed and has sweated in their sleep. They recently switched to sleeping in 100% cotton t-shirts and have noticed that they no longer sweat at night.

when traveling by plane or trying to keep things light it not always possible to bring your favorite full sized bottle of soap and shampoo travel sized soaps and shampoo are borderline criminal with how expensive they are and the selection is often limited at my local cvs oz travel sized bottle of soap was half as expensive as the regular oz bottle which is more expensive per oz instead invest in travel bottle set and fill them with your regular soap shampoo lotion whatever you want there are even small containers for hair styling products often you can find an entire travel set for around the same price as single bottle of travel sized soap since they re made to be refillable they re easy to clean and can last years it great for vacations short trips to visit family or even overnight stays with friend or significant other,Travel sized soaps are expensive and the selection is usually poor. A travel bottle set can be refilled with your regular soaps and shampoos and is cheaper in the long run. They are easy to clean and can last for years.

You are concerned because you have not been informed of any changes to the schedule and the delays seem excessive. You want to know if you can get out of the contract without penalties and whether you are entitled to a refund of your deposit.  

This is a difficult situation and it would be best to consult with an attorney to determine the best course of action. It is possible that the delays could be considered a breach of contract, but there may be provisions in the contract that allow for delays due to weather or other factors. 

It is also important to review the contract itself to determine what, if any, cancellation fees or penalties may apply and whether you are entitled to any refund of your deposit. 

In any case, it is recommended to document all of your communications with the company, including dates and times of when dates were changed and by whom, as well as any other relevant details. This may be useful if you decide to pursue legal action or file a complaint with a consumer protection agency."

context our apartment complex is mixed with the back half being townhouses we rent townhouse on the back property line which overlooks large parking lot the closest row of parking is for tenants and guests of the apartment complex the rest of the parking lot is owned by the local mass transit and is park and ride the last independence day and new year many residents of the complex used the park and ride area of the parking lot to shoot off fireworks for several hours the common ground fireworks and sparklers were no problem other than leaving trash behind however several groups were shooting off fireworks into the air which exploded at heights above our roof this lasted from approximately pm to pm the most recent time the explosions made it impossible to sleep gave our epileptic dog seizures he is medicated and normally averages one seizure every few months and several exploded directly over the trees and roof of our building the park and ride property owner did not have security line and it was after hours for their direct line the police answered but had several hour response time which is to be expected the property manager was the least helpful despite being able to identify several of the tenants and report it to the office they said the best they could do was talk to them as they were not on the property preparing for this new year and ignoring that am being grinch is there any way can preemptively work with the property manager to dissuade more fireworks my reasoning is that our lease has provision that tenants can not interfere with other tenant right to quiet enjoyment as well as the clause on complying with state and local laws fireworks that shoot in the air or travel more than feet are banned in the state of oregon you your occupants and all guests will show due consideration for neighbors and not interfere with disturb or threaten the rights comfort health safety convenience quiet enjoyment and use of the community by us other residents and occupants and any of their guests agents or invitees ii not engage in abusive threatening or harassing conduct toward us or any employees agents or representatives or unreasonably interfere with our owner agent for owner of the community iii exercise reasonable care in the use of the premises and maintain the premises in clean safe and undamaged condition ordinary wear and tear excepted iv comply with all of the policies and procedures contained in the community policies we delivered to you and comply with federal state and local laws regulations statutes and ordinances which are applicable to the premises and your tenancy just because you step ten yards out of the property should not invalidate your responsibility to follow the lease,"Loud fireworks being set off on a parking lot near their apartment complex are disturbing the tenants and even causing seizures in their epileptic dog. The lot is partly leased to tenants and guests, and partly owned by a mass transit company operating a park and ride lot. Neither the lot owner nor the property manager is doing anything to stop the fireworks, even though such explosions violate state law and the tenants' lease agreement. 

The tenants are looking for ways to work with the property manager to prevent the practice in the future."

so work for state agency and there several of us who speak spanish and don get paid for it there only one person who gets paid for it but she never in the office and has other job duties we also take lot of calls and customers at the counter and lot of them are spanish speaking recently people who were being paid spanish pay left but now the state doesn want to pay other people for spanish would always help people because like helping people and especially because know what it like to not have someone understand due to language barrier the thing is that when asked if now they can open up the spanish pay to other people they said it was denied by the higher ups so feel the state is being cheap and wanting us to use our spanish for free so they don have to pay us do have any legal grounds to not use my spanish with customers even though feel bad today when refused my manager was angry and said it still customer service so should be using it just don think it fair and if we continue using our spanish for free they will never give us spanish pay should bring this up to my union sorry if this question has been asked couldn find anything on it here thank you,"You and several of your colleagues speak Spanish and perform Spanish-speaking duties at your state agency, including taking calls and assisting customers at the counter. Recently, employees who were specifically paid for these duties resigned, and your agency is now refusing to pay anyone else for them despite having hired new employees.

Is there anything you can do legally regarding this situation?

hello all have been renting house in suburb of dallas tx for years for little over year starting in friend of mine moved into one of the bedrooms while he tried to dig himself out of hole drug addiction etc during that time he had listed that address as his point of contact and mailing address he was not on the lease yes my mistake that will not be repeated but he and had signed agreement for rent month to month and day requirement for both parties to notify eviction move out with drug possession being an exception in early discovered he relapsed and he was asked to move out obviously formal eviction would be messy but it was not necessary he left since then he has been living under overpasses all over dallas county since then have received numerous warrant notices one as recent as last month opened by my other roommate from three different counties for various things related to his struggles drug possession paraphernalia possession etc ve called the courts in each of these counties to notify them that he is no longer resident here but have been told that they will continue to operate as if this was his residence until he calls to correct it it seems weird to me that they would believe repeat offender over the person who is on the lease so now curious what would be the process to notify these courts that he is no longer resident if he were legitimately on the lease with me could they have been notified by my landlord imagine there have to be process in place or there would be lot of search warrants being executed on hapless residents who just moved into new apartments houses that used to be rented by criminals ps called the bail bondsmen on the warrant notices and let them know where they might be able to find him so this might not be headache for too much longer but obviously like to avoid police officers showing up at my door with search warrant looking for him or anything he might have stashed away if he were still here,"A friend of mine who was not on the lease and just paying rent month-to-month using my address has received warrants for drug possession and other charges. He is no longer living at my place, and I have been notified of warrants. I notified the courts but they want him to call. What can I do since he is not using my address anymore? 

I have also notified the bail bondsmen of his possible location. 

He was not on the lease, but I am curious how this could affect me moving forward."

can be held responsible for an amount due on an apartment if am not the primary leaseholder am in ohio just got something in the mail from my apartment had in telling me owed little over to them despite not being the primary lease holder my ex is the primary lease holder anyway can fight this,"You are likely still responsible for the amount due on the apartment, even though you are not the primary leaseholder. This is because you likely signed a lease agreement or a guaranty agreement wherein you assumed responsibility for any rent owed or other obligations under the lease. You should review any documents you signed when you moved in to determine your liability. 

You should also note that your ex may be responsible for the full amount owed, regardless of whether they have assets or income you can garnish. You should attempt to communicate with your ex about the amount owed and determine together how it will be paid. If no agreement can be reached, you should consult with a lawyer to determine the best course of action. 

It is also recommended that you consult with a lawyer specializing in rental and lease agreements to review your specific case, examine the contract you signed, and provide accurate legal advice. 

Are there any other questions you have regarding your lease agreement?"

edit forgot to mention in colorado hey guys having major roommate issue at the moment and really need some advice on how to handle it apologize in advance for how long this post is ve also changed names for privacy did my best to only give relevant information just know there have been lot more lies and manipulation involved and this is why am very upset backstory am the only other tenant on the lease with my roommate raven who moved in with this past summer our original intention was to add one more roommate for total of in br home however the tenant we found amy wasn able to move in for another two months so raven brought up moving someone in short term our lease doesn allow short term renters so raven found our other roommate bailey and wrote up sublet contract with her stating she stay for months at mo note that our lease also prohibits subletting she ended up staying much longer than expected and won be moving out for another month when amy moved in she made several attempts to get her copy of the lease but the office never followed through so she never signed it anyways since she moved in we ve had all rooms full and were under the impression we were all paying equally with the exception of bailey who was on contract for raven and had conversation months ago in which she asked me if we should keep amy rent the same price she agreed to pay when she agreed to live with instead over other people because it would make ours cheaper basically told her that wasn right so we made an agreement we keep it even between the three of us permanent tenants aside from the extra raven owed for her pets and master bedroom so have been paying since that conversation and assumed amy was too but found out talking to her the other day that raven never lowered her rent and had been overcharging her by for the past months when we confronted raven she told amy that she didn realize she had been overpaying because the money goes into an account she doesn check and she would pay her back knew this was lie because raven is unemployed and couldn have paid rent without checking that account week goes by and raven tells amy that she never actually intended to return the money and she would have to keep paying the same amount she had been wow so obviously amy not being on the lease is moving out at the end of this month this leaves only raven and on the lease and bailey is moving out next month so my options are to either attempt to find another permanent tenant or illegal subletters or find way to get out of this altogether definitely prefer the latter as have lost all trust and respect for raven and do not feel comfortable renting with her much less risking eviction for illegally subleasing so my questions are can get in trouble for being aware of the subletting that occurred even though signed nothing and could technically say had no idea they weren on the lease how would that affect amy and bailey would it be unwise to tell raven will turn her in for fraud for an unrelated incident that occurred while back if she does not buy us out of this lease what other advice do you guys have this is my first time dealing with all of this so completely at loss for what to do sorry for the long winded post and appreciate all who take the time to read it,"A tenant named Raven on a lease is accused of illegally subletting a room to two other individuals, Bailey and Amy.

my wife and her ex husband ended pretty poorly he was emotionally abusive and controlling regardless of that she did not feel right taking the kids from him because they were too young and they would not understand therefore they have custody agreement always go with her to pick them up because she is very uncomfortable around him and he always really mean to her unless around needless to say he hates my guts and that fine although he issued me no trespassing warning that am not allowed on his property my question is can he actually have me arrested for going with her to prevent confrontation and prevent my wife from being harassed we are in the state of virginia,"Your wife's ex-husband hates you and has issued a no trespassing warning, but you need to know if you can help your wife with custody arrangements without facing arrest for trespassing in Virginia. 

It would be wise to consult a lawyer and possibly arrange for police to be present when you pick up the children to minimize the chances of a confrontation. 

It is important that you do not trespass onto his property to avoid escalating the situation and to respect the no trespassing order."

hello am resident of ontario canada two weeks ago signed to buy car from dealership and was told it would likely be ready for pick up last thursday had not heard anything from them and decided to call them on the wednesday before the expected pick up date to see if the vehicle would be ready at this time they told me that they had noticed new dent in the passenger side and had sent it to body shop for repairs and to expect it the following week before purchase inspected the car and there was no dent and they had disclosed to me previous claims so it would seem this dent occurred in the time signed for the vehicle and before picking up the vehicle do have any legal backing to renegotiate the purchase price of the vehicle since there has been damage done to it before received it if no compensation is offered do have any legal grounds to refuse to purchase of the vehicle due to the damage before pick up thank you everybody am open to all advice suggestions on how should proceed,"You signed a contract to purchase a car from a dealership in Ontario, Canada. The car was expected to be ready for pickup last Thursday, however, you found out yesterday that there is a new dent on the passenger side of the vehicle and it has been taken to a body shop for repairs. You had inspected the car prior to signing the contract and were made aware of previous claims, so the dent occurred while the car was in the dealership's possession. 

You are wondering if you have any legal ground to renegotiate the purchase price or refuse the purchase altogether due to the damage incurred before pickup. 

It is important to note that the circumstances of your case may vary based on the specifics of provincial law and the terms of your contract with the dealership. It is highly recommended that you consult with a lawyer specializing in automotive law or contract law in Ontario to obtain tailored legal advice regarding your options and the best course of action."

long story short my roomate bailed on me and ve had to find someone else to take over my lease as can afford it alone the new tenants have signed new year lease asked my landlord if there anything that needs to be signed to officially end my lease and he says it transfer of lease and once give them the keys done worst case if the new guys don pay is there any way my landlord can come back to me for money he also told me don get my deposit back since broke my lease would the text messages from this situation be enough to release me of any financial responsibility,"You can probably give your landlord textual proof that you've found new tenants to take over your lease, thus releasing you from your contractual obligations, but your landlord may still try to pursue you for costs or damages, especially if the new tenants don't hold up their end of the bargain. Depending on the laws of your state, your landlord may have to pursue you for a certain amount of time before they can legally move on to the new tenants, if that becomes necessary. 

As for the deposit, your landlord is correct that you breached your lease by moving out early, and they can likely use that deposit to cover any costs related to finding new tenants or making the apartment ready for new tenants. Again, depending on your local laws, they might be required to itemize those costs for you. However, they can't simply keep the deposit in full arbitrarily. 

Make sure to follow up with your landlord in writing to confirm that you're released from your lease and that they won't come after you for any further costs or damages. Keep a copy of that written confirmation for your records."

They never sent you a receipt for the transaction and blocked your number after you requested it several times. You are planning to meet the dean to hold them responsible for sending you a fraudulent contact. 

You could possibly take the following steps:

hello guys hope you can help with this one freelancer living in canada and doing work for nh based construction company we do not have contract but ve been doing this for years the person pay me weekly salary for the past few months the person has not pay me this is not uncommon since we have rough patch before but the difference this time is that the communication is getting harder and twice the person has told me they would pay in certain date and has not done it before they would just tell me they could not do it and would just tell me when they actually do it do have any recourse in case need to get my money or part of it to be fair do not think they want to screw me but want to have options just in case dont have paper to confirm my work with him but do sign the project contracts via docusign do the payment request follow with the gcs and basically the face of the company with the clients and the one person they will call if they have issues owed more than can lean project do need to go to small claim does it even make sense to do anything thanks in advance,"You haven't signed a contract with this client, but you've been working for an NH-based construction company for years. They pay you weekly, but lately, they've been slow to pay you and have been unclear about when you'll be paid. You have no written confirmation of your work for them, but you sign project contracts via Docusign and are the face of the company with their clients. 

You want to know what your options are for getting paid and whether it's worth pursuing legal action. 

Here are some key points to consider: 

1. Documentation: It's important to have documentation of your work, especially when it comes to payment terms and deadlines. While you may not have a traditional contract, any emails, texts, or other written communications discussing payment can serve as evidence in your favor if you were to take legal action. 

2. Payment History: Consider how long this client has been paying you late and whether they have a history of being financially stable. If this is an unusual situation for a client who has generally been reliable, there may be a reasonable explanation for their delay. 

3. Communication: It's important to maintain open lines of communication with your client."

my parents and had falling out without giving details it was pretty nasty when was started trade college and needed for tools my father gave the money willingly calling it an investment into my future he transfered the money through our bank accounts which were connected at the time so there is proof that the money was given to me no written agreement or discussion to pay back the money occurred when asked if he wanted the money back at some point he declined there were multiple occasions where asked this fast forward to today three years later he has given me two weeks to pay the back and if fail to he has threatened to sue for this money am aware of his intentions and they are not to get money he intends to cause financial suffering to me and my fianc does he have any legal grounds here the only proof he has is that the money was exchanged,"You took money from your father three years ago with no discussion of repayment and no written agreement, just a transfer of money from his account to yours. He has now demanded repayment which you have refused. He threatens to sue you for the money. 

You feel he just wants to cause you financial suffering. 

Do you have any legal grounds to refuse repayment? 

It would help to know what country you are in as that will determine what, if any, legal grounds he has to sue you and what your defenses could be. 

You should probably discuss this with a lawyer before he sues you, or if he has already sued you, you need to defend yourself. 

Let me know if you would like me to look for a lawyer for you in your area."

hi was hoping someone could offer advice my partner myself and our six month old son are currently living in house that we have inherited from my parents we originally moved in with my father to look after him after my mother passed away with the intention of eventually buying the house but unfortunately my father lived less than year and we have not had the time to save what we needed too anyway in this time neighbour has put in an insurance claim as they have some subsidence to their property after an inspection it was deemed that large cherry tree and some shrubbery in our garden could have contributed to it and they should be removed we agreed to this work being done back in april this year on the condition that the area where the trees were to be removed would be levelled out and and turfed as otherwise there would be large drop down at the back of our garden and also that it happened over the summer as we intended to put the house up for sale in the winter this was agreed to by the mitigation service working on behalf of the insurer we told the neighbours about this and they said they were going to put up fence we advised them to either wait until the work had been complete or build wall brining that part of the garden level with the rest before putting the fence up my wife who teaches civil engineering also drew them some plans of what was needed they ignored this and whilst we were out of the country visiting family put up fence without the retaining wall so we eventually got date for the work to happen and it happened last week th november lot later than we had hoped the contractors doing the work came and removed the trees then spoke to me about the plans for levelling the garden the next day which were not levelling the garden as agreed but merely compacting the soil and laying some turf on top at this point we went back to the mitigation company and told them they made some calls and came back to us telling us the work that we had agreed to would be carried out we had sent photographs in the exchange and informed them that the ground needed to be raised around ft the next morning the contractors arrived and told us that that is not what they were told to do so they made some calls and eventually ended up coming up with plan for the work that needed to be done passing quote to the insurer and leaving we have no contact with and do not know who the insurer is called the mitigator who said the contractors had agreed to do the work eventually they accepted that it was not what had been agreed they now have the quote and are meant to be passing it on to the insurers as of my last contact this morning they have not done this believe the contractors had passed the quote and plan for the work onto the insurer as they had no idea who the mitigation company was now all of this is preventing us from putting the house on the market and causing fair bit of distress if we had been staying in the house we may not have agreed to the work as the tree held sentimental value although we feel it would have been unfair on our neighbours to deny the work we need the work doing as soon as possible but the insurer and mitigator seem to move at snails pace do have any legal case for breach of contract or for undue stress or anything cannot imagine the insurer will refuse the re quoted work but it may take them another months to do anything about it really just want to force their hand into getting it sorted as quickly as possible,"You agreed to remove trees and shrubs on your property to mitigate subsidence to a neighbouring property. The removal was agreed to on the condition that the garden was levelled and turfed. Your neighbours erected a fence without retaining walls before the work was done, preventing the garden from being levelled as agreed. The gardening work was done to a substandard level and you are now pursuing the insurer to have the garden levelled as agreed. 
You are seeking advice on whether you have a legal case against your neighbours or the insurer."

long story short my buddy married someone and moved to ok where her family is things fell apart about yrs and kids later and he moved back here where his family is we are about hrs and one state line away when the smoke cleared from all of this he ended up with just visitation problem is the visitation is th fri sat every other week his job will obviously not let him just take off thu and fr every other week so he been getting up very early sat morning driving down spending the day with his kids and driving back this is the best he can do he tried to argue in court that this was going to be big hardship for him and the judge literally told him that he was the one who decided to move to another state and if he wanted expanded visitation then he needed to move back to where the kids were never mind that he has no family friends there one of the reasons the marriage failed and his job options there are much more limited than they are where he is now judge told him that was his problem and not the courts now his ex is threatening to take him back to court arguing that he is not exercising his full parental rights that he has therefore said rights should be terminated for whatever it worth before this final ruling from the judge he still had the three day week visitation but he could bring the kids to his house so he would drive down after work thurs pick the kids up bring them the hrs back home where people from his family could watch them while he worked the ex argued that this back and forth was too hard on the kids and that he was bad parent for leaving the kids with the grandparents while he worked and not just spending time with them the judge agreed and so now he can legally only see them in the county they live in he basically burned up all his pto at work taking off thu fri to see the kids so he left with just the sat visits needing to get hotel down there for days to have place to see them also strained his finances severely my question is whether my buddy is screwed here or whether he just needs better lawyer feel like any decent lawyer should be able to make the argument that no dad can reasonably take two days off work every other week in order to see the kids the ex has rejected any attempts he has made to see the kids otherwise like facetime calls on his visitation days she insists that only in person visits are allowed ve seen the court order and do not see anything that says facetime is banned but also nothing that explicitly allows it either does he have any real options here or is he kind of just screwed and at the mercy of this judge and his ex to make things more difficult when he was down there on sat he had been visiting the kids at the house of the one friend he had down there but that friend has indicated that this is hard on him and may not be able to allow it much longer leaving him with no place to go the kids down there is he just screwed here,"A father is having difficulty exercising his visitation rights with his children, as his ex-wife has limited his visitation to every other weekend in the state where she lives, which is far from where he lives. The father has a job where taking off two days every other week is not feasible, and he has already used up much of his PTO. His ex-wife argues that he is not exercising his full parental rights and has threatened to take him back to court. 

The father is wondering if he just needs a better lawyer or if he has any other options to exercise his visitation rights."
was driving in the left lane out of an area of construction so things were somewhat congested saw few cop cars pulled over on the left ahead but there was no easy way to vacate the lane bc the right lane was full did not come close to hitting anyone but sure enough one of them got in the vehicle to come pull me over and give me ticket for not giving clearance to an emergency vehicle know it the law and if it had been convenient at all would have pulled over but the language of that is bugging me this is not the same as not pulling over for an ambulance an er doctor and feel like this is akin to me coding patient and someone yelling at me from out in the hall and me leaving the code to give him an earful know what an emergency and super curious to find out what emergency allowed him to leave it to come give me ticket so want to contest this tempted to say that but realize that prob not the move what the smartest way to do it the court date is of course during shift can get out of and have to notify them in writing my plea of guilty not guilty no contest what do plead obviously guilty but with some extenuating circumstances,"You are being charged with not giving clearance to an emergency vehicle, however you believe the circumstances do not warrant this citation. You are considering pleading not guilty, guilty, or no contest, but would like advice on the best option."

The neighbor, Chris, refuses to take responsibility for the damage to your fence or the injury to your husband. Your husband is a disabled vet and you cannot afford the legal fees to take this matter to court. 

Oregon has stringent rules about harming or cutting down trees. Unfortunately, I cannot provide legal advice, but you may wish to contact Oregon State Bar Association for possible pro bono legal assistance. 

Have you contacted your homeowners' insurance company to see if they cover incidents caused by neighbors? You may want to contact animal control to ensure that your dogs are safe if the tree were to fall on your side of the fence. 

I'm so sorry to hear about your husband's injury. Please be safe and try to communicate with your neighbor calmly if possible."

im thinking about starting podcast where simply read reddit stories now the issue with it is some stories are so old that its sometimes by deleted user or people simply dont respond so my question is can just simply pickup stories from reddit off the bat and read post them without the op permission would get in some form of legal trouble for it and would it be advisable to credit their username while reading stories or should leave it out,"You can read stories from Reddit on your podcast without prior permission from the original poster (OP) but there are certain legal risks involved and there are steps you can take to minimize these.

It is advised to credit the original OP to avoid plagiarism and copyright issues. However, since Reddit usernames are not unique, you might consider citing the source URL to give proper credit. 

To further minimize legal risks, ensure you do not read stories that might infringe on copyright, defame someone, or invade privacy. Also, avoid using any personal information about the OP or other users that might identify them indirectly (e.g., their job, location, or other unique details). 

It is also good practice to reach out to the OP if you plan to read a story they posted, not only to ask for permission but also to give them a chance to opt-out if they wish to. This can serve as a waiver of sorts should they change their mind later. 

Lastly, having a good understanding of applicable laws and copyright regulations in your jurisdiction is essential to navigate these risks properly. 

Note that this is general advice and not specific to any law or jurisdiction. For precise answers, please consult a legal professional."

just so clear do not want to use the actual music itself to be playing with my web comic however do want to imply that there music playing in the background of scene by writing down the song lyrics of course would put an author note crediting the artist and name of song if were to do that would have to pay for some sort of license to do so,"You would need to obtain a license from the music copyright holder, crediting the artist and song is not enough on its own. 

Sync licenses (also known as synchronization licenses) are necessary whenever music is paired with visual media, such as in a YouTube video, a movie, or a podcast. 

A sync license grants the rights to use a musical composition synchronized with visual media. Even if you don't plan on using the music itself, obtaining a sync license is usually necessary for lyrical works. 

It's important to note that the process of obtaining a sync license can vary depending on the music and the copyright holder, it might be best to consult a legal professional or the copyright holder directly to ensure that you obtain the necessary license to use the music lyrics in your web comic."

hi live in hybrid condo co op style building in nyc we own the apartment paid cash so no mortgage just wanted to know if there are legal grounds to kick someone out of the building if it is hybrid condo co op situation what would be case where they could do this thanks so much,"If you live in a hybrid condo-coop building in NYC and you own your apartment, you likely cannot be evicted from your unit as you have ownership. 

However, there may be cases where you could be evicted from the building if you violated building rules and regulations. These rules are set by the cooperative corporation and enforced by the board of directors. Examples of violations could include things like disruptive noise, smoking where it is prohibited, or unsafe behavior. 

I recommend double-checking with a legal professional specializing in coop/condo law to ensure the circumstances around possible eviction."

However, you would have to prove that your claim is merited and that the dog owner is liable for the injuries caused to you. Given that you've already won a judgment against the dog owner in small claims court, you may simply need to provide the home insurance company with copies of the legal documents confirming that you won the case and are entitled to payment for damages. 

It may be worthwhile to consult with an attorney before contacting the home insurance company to ensure that you have adequate evidence of the dog owner's liability and your damages, and to determine the best approach for seeking payment from the insurance company."

in california recently worked with hair salon to get treatment done and there was follow up treatment scheduled without my knowledge until the day of contacted them to cancel reschedule but then they followed up with charging me fee for the same day cancelation that is more than the service itself there is no mention of same day cancelations on their site and realized that the treatment that paid for was twice as expensive as it is on their website refusing to pay for service that did not agree to but is it possible that they can pursue legal action and if so do have case to defend myself if it comes to that,"You want to know if a business in California can legally pursue charges for a cancellation fee for a service you agreed to, but then canceled and want to know if you can defend yourself since there was no prior mention of a cancellation fee on their website. 

I cannot provide legal advice, but I can provide you with general information on the subject matter that you can use to formulate your further steps. 

It is indeed possible for this salon to pursue legal action against you for failure to pay the cancellation fee. Whether they will pursue this action depends on the exact circumstances and their willingness to do so, as well as the potential costs and expected benefits from this course of action. 

In order to properly advise you on potential defenses in this matter, I would need more information on the exact services provided, conversations had with the salon staff, any written agreements or emails regarding the service and its cost, and the amount of the cancellation fee they are attempting to charge you. 

To better protect yourself in the future when engaging with businesses for services, I recommend requesting a written estimate and any possible additional fees that could arise, as well as any potential penalties for canceling the service upfront, prior to receiving the service itself."

hi legaladvice resident at large collegiate housing community in indiana the housing itself is fine slightly overpriced yet there is feeling of cutting corners where ever the leasing property management can recently they have been non stop promoting student satisfaction survey the bone they throw is represented as such through the emails from the actual consultancy conducting the survey they represent the following as thank you note we ll put your name in for quarterly cash drawing odds change depending on the responses received for each quarter sponsor will conduct two random drawings to award the prizes one for each for the prospects and the resident survey sponsor will randomly select two winners from all eligible entries received the drawings will be conducted within two weeks of the end of each quarter sponsor will make reasonable efforts to notify the winners by email address or by phone and send each of the winners check within approximately three weeks of the completion of the random drawing provided that the winner has complied with the publicity requirement there will be two prizes awarded each consisting of five hundred dollar check meanwhile official emails from the sponsor read as follows to sweeten the deal we re offering chance for you to win up to all you need to do is complete the survey by november and your name will automatically be added to our drawing does this not seem illegal they clearly state that there is possibility to win up to whereas the fine print dictates that it is only prize any idea if this is protected by consumer laws within indiana,"You suspect that a housing community in Indiana is conducting illegal lotteries based on their representation of a ""cash drawing"" for residents who complete a survey.

california us there long sequence of events but the ultimate question is this what is the legal theory underlying the common human resources policy that potentially intoxicated employee should be prevented from leaving driving an employee is suspected of being very drunk there is reasonable suspicion for the purpose of mandatory testing under penalty of termination as spelled out in company policy but there is not certainty that crime has been committed that would allow citizens arrest the employee quits while being transported between drug testing clinic and the company office and demands to be dropped off at public sidewalk we have no basis to detain her but may face liability for stranding her while we think she dangerously intoxicated hr demands we ignore her request and return her to the office back at the office hr does not want us to allow her to get in her car and leave for fear of liability again she is no longer our employee and not aware of legal basis to detain her luckily police arrive before have to decide whether to follow hr instructions could go into the whole story if anyone likes it good one but these are enough facts for my question to be understood if not making an arrest and lose my authority as employer then how can not let an employee who quits go home just based on reasonable suspicion that the former employee might be intoxicated feel like this is something that could still come back as lawsuit unless am protected in some way ve never heard of before,"A company has a policy that an employee who is suspected of being drunk should be subjected to mandatory testing, and termination if reasonable suspicion is correct. An employee is suspected of being drunk, but quits mid-way through being transported to a drug testing clinic. The company is worried about liability if they let the ex-employee drive away, but also lacks a legal basis to keep them from doing so."

On the way to his hotel, he insisted on kissing and dry humped you. Once there, he continued to aggressively touch you and tried to coerce you into having sexual intercourse. You refused and he stopped. 

This is coercion and sexual assault. You should file a police report and consult with a lawyer to determine whether you want to take legal action. 

It is also important to contact a trusted friend or loved one to share what happened and process your emotions. Consider contacting a domestic violence organization for support and resources."

had an incident today that has left me very worried and incredibly anxious so asking here earlier today was driving home with my girlfriend in the second to leftmost lane on the highway car sped up behind me and passed aggressively without blinkers and switched to the lane in front of me then switched lanes to the leftmost lane and sped up little the driver that had passed me then merged into my car not into the space in front of my car but into my car itself this happened on highway where there was no hov lane or shoulder for me to swerve into but did my best to move over to avoid collision all the while was also honking my horn hoping that the other driver would eventually stop to which they did after getting incredibly close to my car following this they swerved back into their lane and then got behind me tailgating me for while stayed following the flow of traffic and did not switch lanes or speed up following this they pulled up next to me twice admittedly was upset that this person had almost caused an accident and flipped them off when they pulled up next to me however their windows were very tinted and could not see into their car following this they pulled away and left thought that this was close call and that this was the end of it until three hours later two highway patrol officers knock on my door the other driver had taken video of my car following the collision but there is no video of the collision itself apparently the other car had slightly touched my tires while was trying to veer away and there was tire scuff on the side of my car gave the officers my statement which was what typed above and they informed me that this was currently classified as hit and run which is misdemeanor with possibility of jail time they noted that because was present sober and very cooperative it would help my case they also noted that because the damage was very minor and there were no injuries it was unlikely that the charges would be filed they said that the reports of both drivers would go to the da and that they would be in charge of deciding whether or not this would be pursued so incredibly anxious about this ve never hit anyone before and ve only had infraction tickets speeding and stop sign genuinely did not notice that our cars even touched ve had couple fender benders in which people have barely scraped my car and pulled over immediately have no legal or financial reasons to run wish could contact the driver and clear everything up but know that legal pitfall college student and terrified of misdemeanor on my record what likely to happen to me don even want to claim insurance at this point because the damage to my car is practically nothing the cops advised me to report the incident to my insurance which have done now waiting and it killing me please give me some advice,"You were driving on the highway when another car switched lanes abruptly in front of you, causing a minor collision. The other driver then drove off, but later contacted the police and filed a hit-and-run report. The police visited you regarding this incident and informed you that due to the minor damage and absence of injuries, it is unlikely charges will be filed. However, as a precaution, you should report the incident to your insurance provider."
so im not sure this is actually going to happen but mutual friend reached out and told me that my ex had told him she was going to so want to get ahead of the game dont even know what her grounds reasoning would be she works at store next to the vape shop that go to go here maybe once or twice every weeks depending on how much im vaping that week or if go there for cbd sleep gummies occasionally because of the shared parking lot have to drive past and then walk back past the store where she works to get to the vape store do not loiter outside the building wander around the store for hours or anything like that hell went in for the first time in at least year like week ago was not paying attention to anyone actually in the store was looking for specific type of permanent marker for context it generic dollar store and they sometimes have the weirdest things anyway they did not have what was looking for and left was probably in the store for maybe minutes at most guess im just looking for advice as far as what can do if she does go to the police to protect myself what kind of evidence do need to prove that these are made up accusations lastly when say crazy mean literally crazy she manic depressive with schizophrenia she self medicated with alcohol for the better part of her life im hoping this is just manic episode or she was drunk which would not surprise me she also on probation for assaulting paramedic who was trying to help her when she passed out at bar years ago or so do not know if that will carry any weight with the courts on this situation or not,"A mutual friend informs you your estranged ex-partner intends to lodge a complaint against you with the police for alleged stalking. You regularly visit a vape shop near the dollar store where she works. Your visits sometimes involve stopping in the store to buy CBD sleep gummies. You are concerned about possible accusations of stalking and the implications should she take the matter to the police. She has a history of mental illness, alcohol abuse and is on probation for assaulting a paramedic."
long story short was having difficult time finding rental home after break up which caused me to terminate my lease with my girlfriend about halfway through and looking for new rental after month of frustration settled for an airbnb while looked for something ideal after months found house actually also on airbnb and contacted the owner who seemed receptive and friendly and had extensive reviews the house was on my wish list for two months and was not rented not sure how long it was previously vacant so we negotiated longer term rental at substantially lesser rate than the airbnb month to month price they were asking and they agreed on mo what pissed me off is once signed the lease moved in and googled the address it was on multiple real estate sites offered for rent at month obviously the owner did not disclose this clearly it deceptive and dishonest but were they legally obligated to disclose that the home was listed for rent at feeling ripped off here,"You rented a house you found on Airbnb for a reduced monthly rate on the assumption that the unit was not listed for rent elsewhere. 

After moving in, you found that the address was listed on several real estate sites with a different monthly rental rate, which implies that the landlord was trying to attract multiple tenants for higher rents. You are upset that the landlord did not disclose this information beforehand. 

This situation is questionable regarding legality, and you are unsure if you have any recourse; it would help if you discussed this with a lawyer specializing in rentals and contracts."

You have been trying to get your money back for these fees for months without success."
will receive an acd for misdemeanor charge it was the first time was ever involved with law enforcement ve been really worried about it despite my lawyer telling me it the best possible outcome wouldn an outright dismissal be the better outcome ve heard that having the acd open for months means that the public can still view the pending charges against me ve also heard that third party background check websites can get access to the information in this timeframe and then will obviously not be under the jurisdiction of the sealing after the adjournment period meaning my information could still be public through these sites is that something should be worried about also how likely is it that the dismissed sealed charges will affect me in the future will never be trusted again because was arrested know limited agencies can view the record after the sealing but even then if get pulled over for ticket in the future will the police officer ticketing me be able to see my sealed arrest and does simply having an arrest without conviction on my record bar me from getting certain jobs like in education or counseling was kind of considering doing do one day but now wondering why they ever let someone be teacher or therapist if they were arrested can someone please put my mind at ease everyone keeps telling me an acd is great outcome but knowing there will always be record of my arrest held against me is really upsetting,"You are worried that although you will receive an ACD (adjournment in contemplation of dismissal) for a misdemeanor charge, which your lawyer views as the best possible outcome, you are concerned that this will still affect your future employment prospects and be a permanent black mark against you. 

You are particularly concerned that the charge will still be visible to third parties through background checks, and wonder if this is something you should be worried about, and whether a dismissal would be a better outcome. 

You would like reassurance that an ACD outcome will not negatively affect your life indefinitely moving forward. 

An ACD is a favorable outcome compared to a conviction, and while it does not entirely erase the event of your arrest, it is not considered a conviction and will not show up on most background checks for employment purposes. 

However, it is true that certain government agencies and positions, especially those in the education field, may request information about your arrest record pursuant to the California Education Code. 

Because an ACD is not a conviction, you should be prepared to explain the circumstances surrounding your arrest in order to best advocate for yourself."

so here the thing owe on loan due to disability can no longer work or pay the loan ve communicated this with my loan giver forget the words sorry it late and my brain is mush and they said it doesn matter that dealing with disability and unemployment ll have to pay but they ve been calling and texting me in the state of washington they aren allowed to call me more than times week but get calls times day it is within the hours of but ve gotten as much as calls in one week this has been going on for probably weeks now what id like to do is sue for harassment and have the whole loan disappear but know that that probably not likely but ya never know wanted to ask they haven threatened me but they also haven given alternative options other than making half payments at time thankfully have no collateral and don own anything any tips advice know that ll probably have to get the loan sold to debt collector agency or something there just isn much that can be done so pretty withdrawn rn,"You are being harassed by your loan provider despite you informing them you are unable to pay your loan due to disability and unemployment. They are violating Washington state law by calling you more than twice a week, and you are considering suing them for harassment. You wonder what your options are regarding your loan. 

Unfortunately, I cannot provide legal advice, but I can offer some general suggestions. It might be helpful to document the frequency of their calls and any threats they make. You could do this by keeping a record of their calls and texts, including the date and time of each contact. You could also consider reaching out to an attorney to understand your legal rights and determine if suing for harassment is a viable option. 

It is also important to remember that you should not ignore the issue of your debt. Attempt to work collaboratively with your loan provider to establish a payment plan you can afford, or explore alternatives like debt forgiveness or debt consolidation. If your loan is sold to a debt collector, you could be eligible for additional protections under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. 

It might also be helpful to reach out to a financial counselor or advisor for help with your debt. They can help you create a budget and guide you through your options."

so our rental property was recently bought out by another company who added mysterious water bill of month varying home to home for all of the sprinklers in the neighborhood this number did seem absurd considering the amount of properties each paying this sum of money and it was odd that it was billed to separate company in another state against my advice my roommate took it upon herself to investigate these charges and contacted this company pretending to be an employee of our rental company she played the role well enough to get full breakdown of the water usage per month sent to her email ll admit the spreadsheet and numbers looked abnormal but she then called our rental company still posing as one of our property managers inquiring about the numbers have no information after that point she went from talking about it all day to not at all so wondering if something happened anyways slightly worried about any legal repercussions she or although wasn involved past being aware of the situation could potentially face not sure if this is illegal since she didn profit off of it but is posing as company and obtaining documents considered crime,"Your roommate investigated mysterious water bills by posing as a employee of your rental company and obtained a breakdown of the water usage. She then contacted the rental company to inquire about the abnormal charges. You are concerned she may face legal repercussions for posing as a company and obtaining documents. 

It is important to note that obtaining someone else's personal information or documents through fraudulent means may be considered illegal, and could result in legal consequences. It is best for your roommate to stop investigating the situation if she has not yet contacted the company directly. If she is concerned about the charges, she can contact the company directly to inquire about the water bills and discuss her concerns. 

It is also recommended to review your state's laws and regulations regarding identity theft and fraud to better understand the legal implications of this situation."

hi all venturing into the bike business in australia planning to import from chinese manufacturer and add our own branding we ve hit roadblock though finding liability insurance is proving to be quite challenging we have noticed that other retailors seem to hand off liability via the terms and conditions the liability section here seems to palm off all responsibility to the manufacturer is transferring liability to the manufacturer feasible strategy for us or would be still be held liable if something went wrong and person was injured on the bike do these other companies just work without it any insights or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated also planning to seek legal advice but first hand experiences or knowledge would be incredibly helpful thanks in advance,"You can't just pass on liability to the manufacturer in your terms and conditions. That will probably not hold up in court if someone gets hurt and decides to sue you. Other companies probably have liability insurance, or are operating in countries with less stringent liability laws, or are taking the risk of operating without insurance. You should definitely seek legal advice, perhaps from a lawyer who specializes in liability law.  It may be possible to structure your business in such a way as to limit your liability, for example by forming a legal entity such as a corporation, but you would need expert advice on the specific steps you could take. 
Obviously, riding bicycles involves some risk, and you may have to weigh the risks and costs of liability insurance vs. the cost of product improvements that would make your bicycles safer, or the cost of saving a few dollars by not offering insurance or legal protections to your customers. 

Let me know if you have any other questions about starting your bike business!"
thanks in advance for taking the time to read ll do my best to be thorough without being wordy builder ryan homes provided topographical map of our sublot prior to build we took possession this year in january prior to final grade of the home being completed due to northern ohio weather this is pretty normal the topographical map always showed slope to drainage swale in our rear yard so we weren surprised by that but after the final grade was completed and approved we thought the slope and degree of the slope going into the swale was excessive we asked ryan project managers and were told what exists there is the city approved plan this was around when the work was done in july am still unhappy with it and decided to call the city they sent me as built plans and it shows that the final grade numbers are off in that area by foot as compared to the original topographical map this plan was city approved ohio code suggests is the max deviation the city building dept told me that the reason for this excess deviation was due to nearby common area not draining properly and thus the entire area in my rear yard was dug deeper to allow for proper drainage essentially they made it seem to me like they didn have choice however this affects my use of my property directly and was not informed of the change or didn have any say in if was okay with it additionally keep in mind there are options that could have allowed for the numbers to have matched the original plan like drainage pipe culvert but am assuming that was factor now am waiting to hear back from the local building dept as they were going to see what they could do regarding this but does anyone know if these national builders or city have any responsibility to inform or get approval for grade deviation is this worth getting legal counsel involved with before follow up with the city again thanks for reading and any advice offered,"You should consult a legal professional about this as they would be able to provide you with the best advice. Essentially, it sounds like there was a deviation from the approved city plan that was not communicated to you by the builder. This deviation may have been necessary to accommodate for proper drainage, but it is also affecting your property. 

It does not sound like there is any legal obligation for you to be informed of these changes, but it is worth looking into to ensure that your property is not damaged or devalued unnecessarily. 

Were you able to obtain copies of the city regulations regarding drainage and grading? It might be helpful to review those to better understand what is permitted and why."

Regarding the meetings you haven't been paid for, as you intend to start your own cafe one day, it is important to understand that whether or not you have to pay your employees for meetings will depend on several factors, including state laws, industry standards, and the type of meetings."

this happened in wisconsin just last week was working on farm for the first time and the owner was almost immediately hostile he would yell about everything imply that everything you were doing was stupid etc most the guys working there were from nicaragua and because know little spanish tried my best to translate for them so they could understand what the owners were asking for anyways one day the owner says he should not have to pay me because it takes me hours to do something whereas it might take someone else hours told him it was my first time working on farm so would need more than days to learn the best practices the same day another employee decides to whistle at me instead of saying my name and tell her not to whistle at me and an argument ensues the owner comes over and tells me to shut the fu up and if do not like it can go it am at this point only an hour into our morning chores which begin at am every day he tells me to go and tell him if he going to fire me need notice living on one of his properties along with the undocumented folks so if he fires me do not know how long have to leave do not have phone on me we had just had hour day the day prior and because of that we were being given the rest of the rest of the day off after morning chores that day remind him that if he forces me to leave the farm is miles away from the property staying and he told me these roads have bears deers and all kind of wildlife to which he replies do not give fu fearing what he might do leave and his wife gets something from the car shortly after while outside in the pitch black of the early morning beg his wife the other owner to just help me get home because do not know how to get there the nicaraguan guys are always the one to take me from the house to the farm each day so if leave before the shift ends fucked she tells me do not know what to tell ya and goes inside it was degrees outside when finally got to safety that afternoon looked it up spent the morning wandering around injuring my shins wearing the work boots never took off because did not change back into my regular shoes before left was worried about asking his direct neighbors for help assuming they might be at all like this guy who would leave me in this situation with no phone in below freezing weather with no means to get home and not to my surprise when encountered the first person that asked for help after told him what had happened and asked him to please call the police he told me he could not help with no explanation eventually found neighbor of his willing to let me call the police the police told me there would be an incident report but ultimately would have to leave his property was staying at since was no longer an employee at the farm so in one moment do not have job or place to live and left destitute used credit cards and relied on the police and family to get home but ultimately know this should not have been able to happen lot of people will not believe this post there is nothing in my previous history that says work on farms but ve been working with computers for years and wanted to try something new once felt like was far enough from the owner texted him and asked about my wages to which he did not respond took pictures of the injuries sustained from walking hours in below freezing temperatures and voice recorded everything as to not forget this incident where feel these people essentially left me for dead but want to know what if anything was done wrong in the eyes of the law and what options have,"While working on a farm in Wisconsin, the owner became hostile and told the worker they did not have to pay them wages because of their slow pace of work. After an argument with another employee, the owner told them to leave the property, leaving them stranded without a phone miles from home in freezing temperatures. The worker was injured and had no way to contact the owner or other neighbors for help and was forced to wander around until finding a helpful neighbor who phoned the police. 

What specific laws might have been broken in this situation? 

Are there any laws that protect against this kind of behavior? 

What can be done to prevent this from happening to others in the future? 

Would it be legal for the worker to take any legal action against the farm owner for wrongful termination or failure to pay wages? 

Could the worker sue the owner for negligence if they sought medical attention for their injuries? 

In order to prevent this from happening in the future, it is important to raise awareness and implement workplace safety policies. Employers must adhere to labor laws to ensure fair wages, reasonable working hours, and a safe working environment for their employees."

do the books at my restaurant job few days week we have tip pool where tips are split amongst the front of house staff according to how many hours they worked for the day the kitchen staff is tipped out percentage as well recently couple of the front of house employees came to me to complain that their tips were significantly lower than expected for the shift they had worked investigated and found that on all the days am not doing the books the formula for figuring out the tip out was not being used in fact could not figure out how the numbers were being arrived at the discrepancy was different each time sometimes as little as for the whole front of house sometimes as much as but each time the other person who is the owner of the restaurant did the books some money that was supposed to go to the front of house tip pool was being diverted to the back of house tip pool the back of house is tipped out once week there is no saved documentation of how the much goes into the back of house tip pool every day it is done on notepad and once the week total is arrived at thrown away so there is documentation of how much the back of house gets each week but not the daily number the owner is also the person who does the weekly back of house tips suspect that he is taking money from the front of house tips putting it in the back of house tips and taking the discrepancy off the top for himself it would be easy for him to do because there no documentation and it wouldn be as noticeable over the course of week ve started running the numbers on the days he did the tips and am documenting this feel should do this for at least few weeks to establish pattern and see if there any other explanation for the discrepancy my question is if it turns out he is doing this what should my next step be if confront him and he fires me what do do how much proof do need before make move and what should that move be,"You suspect your boss is stealing money from the front of house tip pool at the restaurant you work at.

live in la and have strange issue that not sure what to do with my landlady is elderly and very active as landlord but is not keeping up with deferred maintenance on her large rental properties in la she makes sure water electricity and heat are working and responds quickly to most typical requests except if it about deferred maintenance or things causing invisible issues like illness have lived here for months in that time have had tree root in my parking space do major damage to the underside of my car for legal purposes don think that will hold much water but was exacerbated over time and then the entire undercarriage cover fell off on the highway exit ramp outdoor furniture disintegrated and complained and ask for replacement but she refused due to and my friend fell through the furniture she was ok mildew and mold smell ve been complaining about from both my units they can find cause nor do they believe me this week new tenant moved in downstairs live in basically duplex and moved out within hours due to mold smell etc there is fence falling over she says it been falling for years due to termites it lines my path home and is leaning into the patio of another apt not direct issue for me but illustrative of the larger problem this evening as was cleaning had opened window then noticed lead in the sill and went to pick it up and the window fell on my finger both crushing it and cutting it to the bone had to go to er have asked for mold inspection or some kind of due diligence and she refuses based on money and that they don see black mold anywhere meanwhile it smells like urine in both apts which is sign of mold every complaint or ask for inspections or repairs are met with commentary about how much her property taxes cost and how she hasn been able to raise rent due to covid none of these things are the issue of the tenant she told me that nurses lived downstairs and none of them smelled mold so it must not be an issue because nurses are mold detectors guess she often says that no one has complained before so it obviously not an issue but running short term rentals often means people don tell you anything they just leave but have heard similar complaints about the state of the property from others who have left including rodent infestation of some kind in the dwelling up the hill from me same property just different domiciles earlier this week asked her for break in rent like off december to help cover cost of car repair cost of an air purifier until can move etc she refused now let add medical bills to the equation the real info the kicker am paying almost month for furnished one bedroom all utilities included month to month no lease she runs short term rentals but people tend to stick around found her on rental app and she then let me contact her off the app to save on fees the only interesting curveball here is that to get my ca id she printed me lease and signed it do still have it is this negligence worth consulting an attorney what do need to prove this not feeling confident that have leg to stand on other than maybe filing claim with her insurance for the medical bills what inspections could even make happen on behalf of my own tenant rights she told me the free mold inspectors don come unless it visible and she won pay hate to be bitch to an older lady who is cool person outside of all of this but this situation is slummy and dangerous and she should retire if she can do this job adequately but that not my business so moving out asap but need to know if there recourse for the rest of it thanks in advance,"You have lived in your current rental for months. The landlord is not keeping up with deferred maintenance on her properties and you have experienced several issues with your unit. You have asked for inspections and repairs to be made but the landlord has refused due to the cost. You are paying a relatively low monthly rent and have no lease. 

It sounds like you are interested in finding out if you have any legal recourse in this situation. It is possible that you could file a claim with the landlord's insurance for your medical bills. It may also be worth consulting an attorney to see if there is a case for negligence. 

Before you take any legal action, it might be worth trying to speak with the landlord one more time and try to resolve the issues amicably. It could also be helpful to research local health and safety codes to see if your landlord is violating any regulations. 

It is unfortunately common for landlords to try to save money by deferring maintenance. This is unfortunately an issue that could have been avoided by having a stronger lease agreement and stronger communication between you and your landlord."

would it be considered conflict of interest for lawyer to be one of three hoa board member who has then interpreted the rules and regulations of the hoa and set special assessment that would benefit their unit at what point does it become point of conflict of interest if it is not already,"As a lawyer, you must avoid conflicts of interest in your professional and personal life.

They then proceeded to threaten you and take your belongings before leaving. You are considering your options around pressing charges for the assault."
can plead the th or state have the right to remain silent in the following situation my son is in jail and has private attorney appointed by the court his attorney submitted over pages of his medical mental health records he is laying the groundwork for the writ of habeas corpus in which the judge should appointment different attorney for my son over year ago before he was arrested he had been hospitalized several times he had been kicked in the head several times by teenagers inside on office depot store the trauma set off another episode and medications were not stabilizing him consistently about week ago he was charged with elder abuse and assault with deadly weapon and am listed as the victim this supposedly happened when he was very sick and just prior to his arrest have been his caretaker all his life am well trained experienced and educated in caring for mental illness and am well aware and accept the risks involved in taking care mentally ill individuals he is diagnosed with bipolar and autism spectrum this complaint was not initiated by me do not know where the complaint is from at this time consider myself witness for the defense and would never say anything that would incriminate him,"You did not provide enough information about the situation to give a definitive answer. However, in general, any statements that you make to authorities can be used against your son if he is charged with a crime. You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer any questions from authorities about your son or any events related to his arrest. If you are contacted by authorities, you may wish to exercise your right to remain silent or contact a criminal defense attorney for specific advice if you choose to speak to authorities. 

Regarding your son's legal representation, courts have wide discretion in appointing counsel and granting motions for new counsel. Usually, to obtain new counsel after an appointment, a defendant must show that there is good cause for the request and that there is a bona fide conflict of interest or other serious problem with the current representation. 

You should speak to your son directly about your concerns and advise him to do the same with his attorney. If he cannot speak to his attorney directly due to the nature of his charges, you may write a letter to the attorney explaining your concerns and asking to meet with them to discuss your son's defense. 

Again, I cannot provide specific legal advice regarding your situation;"

hi at chain fast food restaurant if you re asked to leave early in ny and say no what are the rules on this tried looking it up myself but with no luck essentially found people can be asked to leave early believe but it can be done without non discriminatory system the company simply comes up to you and says hey you have to leave early found solution today too because was looking to stay hours instead of it make difference because without reaching hours week become ineligible for match asked an employee if they be interested in taking an unpaid break so the company would save the half hour of wage they were looking for while meeting in the middle voiced rather stay for my full five hours but was told no the manager said it would be against nys law for someone to get break when they re working less than hours except the other day was forced to clock out for mins while ate quick snack mid shift so this makes no sense as she saying you can take breaks when you work less than hours except they forced me to the other day while ate small snack further no employees have to clock out and was told to when no one else is told to the individual is not the official manager of the store but she training to be one she knows financially have explained how far live away from work and that leaving before hour shift financially doesn make sense for me she didn ask anyone if they were interested in going home early and know at least few people would have know how to do their job so it wouldn have created work imbalance by choosing to send one of them home and keeping me not trying to make anything serious out of this but what are the laws on being sent home early when you re scheduled for shift and more specifically in fast food where there higher protections,"You are entitled to be paid for all hours that you are scheduled to work, unless you choose to clock out prior to the end of your shift. However, a company can ask you to leave early without discrimination. In fast food restaurants, there are certain protections in place to ensure that employees are not abused, but there is not information on whether or not you can be sent home early. 
Often, managers are looking to cut costs and save money, but it is important to understand that you are entitled to work the hours that you are scheduled, so long as you are given no notice of a change in your schedule. 
It is also important to note that while you can take breaks during your shift, you cannot be forced to clock out in order to take said break. 

Are you looking for more information about your specific work circumstances?"

hi submitted an answer pro se to complaint responding to each allegation in the initial complaint for an amex debt of little over and received set of interrogatories which are due quite shortly have been notified via ecourts of trial date that is early in december and want to delay the trial and hope to negotiate settlements with the attorney due to currently not having sufficient funds for lump sum settlement no efforts have been made to contact them as of today would asking the plaintiff attorney to delay the trial date together with the interrogatories deadline which believe to be days be the best course of action or would compelling arbitration be reasonable have to admit know little of arbitration and am unsure if it is even realistic option at this point but any help would be greatly appreciated live in new jersey if that is of any importance thank you,"You have received a trial date in December for a debt you owe to Amex and have been served interrogatories. You are considering delaying the trial and arbitrating the case instead. As you are pro se, it may be sensible to ask for a delay to negotiate a settlement given you cannot currently afford a lump sum settlement. Arbitration may be reasonable, but you should research this option thoroughly. 

You should consider contacting an attorney or legal aid to advise you on your options and the best course of action, especially regarding arbitration. Delaying a trial date may require filing a motion with the court and would depend on the reasons you cite for the delay. An attorney can help you with this."
what is the difference in consequences between getting mph ticket and mph ticket do need lawyer for going mph what are my options also have point on my license currently doubt that helps much any helpful advice would be greatly apperciated please and thank you,"You were going 20 MPH over the speed limit, you have a point on your license already, and you're wondering if you need a lawyer and what your options are. 

I cannot give legal advice, but in general, here are a few things to keep in mind. 

1. The consequences of a ticket vary from state to state and are often determined by the driver's history of violations. In some states, a driver may be able to attend traffic school to have the ticket removed from their record and avoid points on their license. 

2. Tickets for higher speeds may result in more severe penalties, such as a higher fine or a longer period of license suspension. In some cases, a driver may be required to appear in court for a high-speed ticket, even if they have a lawyer. 

3. Having a lawyer may be advantageous in situations where the driver is seeking to reduce the severity of the penalties or have the ticket dismissed. Lawyers can assist in gathering evidence, negotiating with the prosecution, and building a defense strategy. 

4. You may be able to contact the DMV and inquire about your options for reducing points on your license. This may include taking a defensive driving course."

6. Attend court proceedings: If you cannot resolve the matter out of court, you must attend all court hearings and proceedings as required by the court."
last year my parents trailer was infested by roaches and due to my mom poor health and age they could not handle the infestation by themselves but also couldnt afford exterminators when my mom got sick and passed away my dad struggled to manage the whole thing friend of mine moved in to help with my mom and the roaches but could not do anything about the roach problem because by that point it had gotten out of hand meanwhile their neighbor hired my friend to babysit her dog several times and then she accused me of bringing roaches to her house assuming they came in on my bag as had helped him watch the dog the first few times but stoped bringing my bag after the first time it is however likely her broken central air unit caused the opportunity for the roaches to get into her house despite me apologizing and eventually blocking her due to continuous harassment multiple calls and texts she involved her son but he was also blocked out of fear for continuing the harassment my friend continued dog sitting until christmas when the neighbor asked him to watch the dog but he declined because he had plans that is when she started being weird she even mentioned that another neighbor on her other side had roaches before my parents there is possibly that is where my parents roaches came from this information was shared in person and mentioned how she continuously let that neighbor into her trailer after knowing their house was infested to let them sleep and bathe in her trailee the harassment escalated when she demanded money and threatened to expose my dad to the trailer park both to the office and neighborhood she even almost hit my friend with her cane when he told her my dad was getting ready for work before comming out to talk to her as it was pm my dad has been trying to get rid of them in multiple ways but nothing works should also note do not live with my dad live in another state completely and only visit every so often recently she been making the same threats demanding payment and an expensive exterminator my dad cannot afford it and has nowhere to take their four cats while bug bombing doing treatments he also without car and struggling financially which the neighbor knows we re considering doorbell camera but she might continue her actions before we can get one and this is in illinois we have not disclosed this issue to anyone besides family who cant wont help hoping to fix it without bothering others in the neighborhood but my dad doesnt know what to do at this point and no one else in the neighborhood has brought it up to him either my friend also cannot find job due to issues getting state id we re unsure if her threats amount to blackmail or extortion so guess my question is if she comes again can we record her via phone if she gets aggressive again or call the cops when she tries to get aggressive also can she legally go after us me or my dad for any of this,"A neighbor is harassing your father and trying to get him to pay for an exterminator for a roach problem that she believes your family gave to her. She has threatened to expose your family to the trailer park management and neighborhood unless you pay her for the exterminator. 

You are wondering if you can record her in case she gets aggressive again and if you can call the police. You are also wondering if she could take legal action against you. 

You live in a different state than your father and your father is struggling financially. 

It is possible that your neighbor's roach problem is not hers, but hers is infested and hers came from another neighbor who had a previous infestation."

how do go about this what are the legal ways get him to sign over his rights doubt he willingly will but he not even father to his own kid but happily is doing so to another women child that isn his know courts probably won care about that and know can fill for abandonment once it hits months with no contact from him but wondering if there any other ways tia am in utah by the way,"You are wondering what you can do to get rights to your stepchild in Utah since their bio dad is not involved in their life and you would like to know if there are any legal avenues you can pursue since he will not sign over his rights. 

It would be advisable to consult with an attorney who specializes in family law in Utah to figure out what your options are and the best way forward given your circumstances. 

It's also important to note that the interests of the child take precedence in these cases and the court will decide what is in their best interests, weighing factors such as the ability of each parent to provide a stable home and care for the child, as well as the child’s wishes if they are old enough to express them. 

It may also be beneficial to try and discuss things amicably with the child's father and see if you can come to an agreement without having to involve the legal system."

so graduated college in december was unable to find job related to my degree so went back to school to pursue nursing took all of the prerequisites and was accepted into bsn program while in my first semester of nursing school learned that my alma mater the school where received my first degree was starting an absn program if you re not familiar with an absn program it essentially an accelerated way for those with bachelors degree in something else to pursue bsn lot faster met all of the requirements for the program except they required you to take an additional class and it had to be taken at their school so registered for the class and after few weeks into the class found out that was not accepted into the program so dropped the class because there was no reason for me to be taking this class unfortunately had to put the tuition for this class approx onto payment plan because couldn afford it at the time was very confident that would be admitted into this program so thought the class would be worth it they did not tell me during the application process that would have the opportunity to take the class upon admittance into the program so was really devastated that started the class for no reason and started paying for it for no reason the tuition payments are split into and made the first payment but refuse to pay the last because that just ridiculous am now stay at home mom to month old and one on the way have an account balance for approx unfortunately gave up my spot in the last nursing program as was so confident would get into the absn one and am unable to return have been looking into other programs at other schools but of course would need to submit my official transcripts from my alma mater but am unable to do so unless pay the account balance just can bring myself to pay that balance off as have been wronged by that school so many times for example during my last semester my roommate and were notified that another girl would be moving into our dorm mid semester when the girl messaged us to introduce herself she mentioned that she had pet snake and hoped that we were ok with her keeping the snake food in the freezer we didn realize that she meant rats she kept frozen rats in our freezer we were disgusted and could only walk in to my dorm to sleep would shower at the gym avoided the dorm at all costs after couple of weeks we found out that snakes weren allowed in the dorms suspect the girl previous roommates probably complained as well and that why she was sent to our dorm mid semester we decided to reach out to the people over housing but apparently they were already aware and dismissed our concerns of course in march covid happened and we were kicked out the dorms anyway so we just let it go is there anything illegal about that situation want the school to remove the balance from my account so that can access my transcripts not paying it refuse even if we were to be able to afford it now just can give another dime to that school so what asking is if it possible to ask them to remove the balance and if they say no threaten to sue regarding the rat snake situation or is blackmail illegal lol not going to name the school but it is located in al if can access my transcripts will just be content with being sahm guess,The writer is unable to pay the balance on their account due to their alma mater wrongfully rejecting them from a program and forcing them to take a class they did not need. This class cost tuition they were unable to afford and they are now staying at home with their children. They are looking to apply to other schools but are unable to do so until they settle their account with their current school.

have been renting home in la city for over two years and currently on month to month lease the landlord wants to sell the property and asked us to move out notified them of the just cause ordinance which does not allow them to terminate our tenancy because they want to sell which they did not seem aware of however despite not wanting to move told them would agree to move if given some more time and relocation assistance communication transferred to the landlord attorney who sent me an offer to credit the last month rent if vacate in days after looking for new home and facing insanely high rent prices felt like this was not enough and it would not make financial sense for me to move by accepting this offer so asked for higher buyout amount waited for response for over week and finally got an email from the landlord lawyer saying they are no longer representing them so emailed the landlord directly reiterating my proposal and got an email back saying they will not pay what we re asking do not care at all about our financial needs and accused me of blackmail and being the reason this country is going down the drain among some other accusatory and insulting things was bit surprised by this as expected them to just come back with counter offer intentionally aimed high in anticipation of this and thought we would likely meet somewhere in the middle have been very reasonable and cooperative trying to approach this as business transaction without getting emotional even though this has been incredibly stressful and the prospect of moving and needing to find new home in this crazy market would be major disruption to my life so wondering if anyone has any advice on what should do now or what the landlord might do or can do at this point wrote back and calmly said am open to negotiating and finding something we can mutually agree on but have not heard back the landlord lives in million dollar home in beverly hills and owns rental properties in la and they will be making major profit off the sale of this house which they ve owned for over years so what asking for is far from impossible for them they just do not like the laws and tenant protections and wish this could be as easy as possible on them without caring how it is affecting us as tenants being displaced appreciate any advice or suggestions thank you,"Landlord wants to sell their rental property and wants you to move out. You informed them about just cause ordinances and that they cannot terminate your lease because of sale of property.

They dispute the eviction notice sent by the stepchildren's lawyer on the basis that the stepchildren cannot evict them as they are not on the deed to the property; your parents have made improvements to the house and paid taxes, and have had no contact with the landlord whom they believe may be deceased."

got hit with speeding ticket on my way back from ny to ontario the charge is for doing mph in zone will most likely end up trying to fight the ticket to reduce the charge but should go with legal team based in ontario or one based in new york or does it really matter,"You were charged with speeding on your way back to Ontario from New York. The ticket alleges you were driving at mph in a zone with a speed limit. You're considering fighting the ticket and wonder if you should hire a legal team based in New York or Ontario to help with this. 

It is generally recommended to seek local legal counsel for specific legal issues like fighting a speeding ticket. A legal team based in Ontario would likely have a stronger understanding of the local laws and regulations, as well as the local court processes which could be beneficial in fighting your speeding ticket. 

However, if there is an specific lawyer or legal team that you have a rapport with or have a recommendation for, it might be worth engaging with them to see if they can represent you remotely or refer you to a colleague locally. 

Ultimately, the choice of legal counsel is up to you and you should choose a lawyer or team that you feel confident will represent your interests effectively."

have quick question for anyone who might be able to give me some guidance this last thursday broke my thumb while at work immediately reported the injury and the safety director at work scheduled me an appointment for my primary doctor after going and getting an ray my doctor scheduled me visit to hand specialist the next day informed our safety director of all of this and he told me to keep him updated the next day after my appointment with the hand specialist the next day informed our safety director of what they said and waited to hear back later that afternoon he called me and said would need to take drug test for workman comp to approve everything have yet to take the drug test mainly because want to find out the validity of it before taking it was completely sober at the time of the accident and always sober when im working use legal form of cannabis when off the clock to help manage pain and anxiety and that is where worried there no way to prove my sobriety at the time of the accident at this point now is there would have gladly taken drug test right after the accident had it been brought up to me but nothing was mentioned until the next day just afraid that workman comp will not cover it now because was not tested right after the accident any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated,"You hurt your thumb at work and informed your director of safety, who helped you set up appointments with your primary doctor and a hand specialist. The hand specialist recommended medication and you informed your safety director, who then requested you take a drug test. You are concerned because you legally use cannabis off the clock to manage pain and anxiety, and wonder if this will affect whether your worker's compensation will be covered. You are mainly concerned because you were not asked to take a drug test immediately after the accident."
have very overwhelming fear of dying and leaving my children without parents want to know if there is way to leave legal instructions that their new guardians would have to follow back story was raised in high control religion my brother and sister in law are still in the religion they are the only people feel could financially and emotionally support my children in the event of tragic accident where their father and both die we have no one else this religion doesn allow blood transfusions if my kids were to need it certain mental health care is frowned upon they would try to pray the mental illness away instead of seeking medical treatment,"You are concerned about what would happen to your children if you and their father were to die, and you want to make sure that your children would receive the proper care and upbringing from your brother and sister-in-law, despite their involvement in a high-control religion that you think might compromise their ability to care for your children how you would want. 

You are looking for a way to leave legal instructions that would require your children's potential new guardians to seek medical care for your children and follow your wishes regarding their upbringing."
this is first ever post on reddit so do not come after me my grandmother rents in the same apartment as do they are not the best but definitely could be worse of course there are roaches which you can blatantly seeing running around outside everywhere but what have never seen before is rats first time we came across them at her place was maybe year ago as her dogs we always going crazy and running after them of course the first thing we did was tell our landlord and she quite frankly did nothing no exterminator did not even bother to look in the apartment all she said she could do is set traps outside around my grandmothers apartment and hope for the best as she blamed it on my grandmother having doggy door my dad took it upon himself to catch all of them in rat traps and we showed our landlord the pictures of them rats my dad caught in these traps they ruined some many things in the walls and wires and pipes they were burrowed behind the stove and the dishwasher my dad ended up having to cut hole in the wall where they were all in to get them all and he had to do all the labor for everything our landlord did not bat an eye not once she also refused to reimburse us on anything we had to buy to solve this problem year goes around they are back we do not know how many or anything but my grandmother found in her trash can and one that chewed off lid to one of her food containers again my landlord does not care will not listen or do anything and it baffling to me that she just acts like this is not big issue my grandmother has now proceeded to set traps around her place again and we are now having to do everything on our own again to solve this problem what do we do do we report them can we even report them is it there obligation to fix this or is it ours again she rents she does not own the apartment,My grandmother's apartment is infested with rats. Our landlord refuses to hire an exterminator or fix the issue. My dad and grandmother have had to trap the rats and repair the damage themselves. What can we do about this issue? Can we report them? Would it be unreasonable to expect them to fix this?
worked for company for years the last yrs of my employment was in management position well the company was sold and we were told by the new owners that all employees were being kept on and keeping their positions wages week later was given paper that stated due to the company now having general manager my position was being eliminated and my services were no longer needed have come to find out that week after letting me go they have hired someone to do what did and gave them my previous title now my question is since was told the position was eliminated and that was the reason given for termination is there anything that can be done since they reinstated said emlinated position week after was gone do live in at will state have applied for unemployment and im sure ll get it but its still being reviewed and not really livable wage,"You were told your position was eliminated due to the company restructuring after being acquired by new owners, however you come to find out they hired someone for your previous position. Since you live in an at-will state, unless you have a contract stating otherwise, you are likely not able to do much regarding being reinstated with the company.  You should pursue other employment opportunities and await the decision from unemployment benefits. 

Were you able to apply for other positions at this company since they hired someone else for your previous role?"

ve worked at my current company for years now and was promoted in august the promotion process alone was pressing me because they kept bringing up how young am and how it scares them but eventually was promoted in the system in august flew to their home state for training in october signed my offer letter in october and came back to my state to continue working for while thought my raise would start when finished my training in their home base state was previously getting paid hr then moved to while being prepped for the promotion in september as interim pay my offer letter was for yr salary which was okay with signed and have been waiting for that pay to reflect was told it was an error that my pay had not changed from august and last month was told they were going to fix it and give me back pay from august was told that in october still being told we re still working on it every time check up on it my age is constantly brought up every time my position comes up so curious if they re hesitant to pay me now just because of my age turning in dec am promoted in the system to operations manager doing ops manager duties have company credit card have access to all the systems all the bells and whistles they just have not fixed my pay my regional manager tells me that it ll be fixed but its been months know that it does not take that long from experience keep being reassured by my regional manager that am owed that money but still have not been given it or the raise what are my rights do have any is there anything can do is there something should do,"You should document all of your conversations about your promotion, specifically the promises of back pay and your promotion salary. You should also gather evidence of your duties and responsibilities as they align with the role of an Operations Manager. This way, if you choose to pursue this issue with your company or outside parties like HR or legal entities, you have evidence to support your claims. 

It is concerning that you have not been paid the correct amount since August. It is also concerning that age discrimination may be a factor in the delay of your back pay and raise. 

You should pursue dialogue with your regional manager and HR department about your concerns. If those conversations are not fruitful, you may consider pursuing legal action against your company for unpaid wages and discrimination. 

It is recommended that you consult with an attorney who specializes in employment or labor law to determine the best course of action moving forward.

had put in two weeks notice at my current job but got sick with covid and messaged my boss and informed her that will not be returning to work she responded by telling me that my hourly wage for the last pay period would be docked to and claimed that had signed the employee handbook stating that had agreed to this my last night there looked through my paper work to see what forms had actually signed found the employee handbook with signing log that employees have signed stating that they have read the handbook and agree to what is in it did not sign the handbook another form relating to the handbook did have my signature the form read this will acknowledge that had seen copy of the employee handbook and know where it is located the employee handbook describes important information about arby and is available for you to read at any time you are not working on the clock you can contact the franchisee owner name at for any questions you may have that are not located in the hand book understand that am employed for no specified length of employment and that either arby or can terminate the relations at will with or without cause at any time so long as there is not violation of applicable federal or state law this handbook is not contract of employment since the information policies and benefits described in the handbook are subject to change understand that revisions may occur at any time under the company sole discretion except to arby policy of employment at will also understand that any revision may supersede modify or eliminate existing policies understand that it is my responsibility to read and comply with the policies contained in the handbook and any revisions made to it should acknowledge that did not work for arby but rather different fast food restaurant with similar spelling my signature was on the form but not the actual handbook and was not dated do have any options is it worth contacting the department of labor,"You signed an acknowledgment form that you saw and know where to find the employee handbook, but you did not sign the handbook itself. This fast food restaurant employs workers at will, meaning they can be fired at any time without cause, and the handbook is not a contract of employment. Your signature is on a form but not on the handbook, and you are unsure if you are still employed at this restaurant. 

It might be worth contacting the department of labor to understand your options moving forward from this situation."

grad student here am in small college town in ma and have few questions to consult you guys here before meeting the legal services at the university after the holiday so could get better prepared for the meeting thanks so much in advance story time first my landlord has house close to the campus of which she rents out bedroom to my partner and me and another bedroom to an undergrad when we initially contacted the landlord in the spring she told the of us that she would be traveling and it would be the three of us living in the house we ended up renting the rooms because the of us tenants met ahead of time and realized that we would get along well night owls but we are respectful and like to study in our rooms however when we moved in the house in mid july the landlord was away until the end of july we soon realized that the landlord also lives on site she only was away for about days in total and has been living with us pretty much all the time not only we have found her to be extremely invasive and disrespectful to us we also have found her behaviors and words to be aggressive things turned lot worse after one of her pet bit me and had to get rabies shots and dap because the pet had not been vaccinated she did not offer any sincere apology and that was not even the worst part of the story because doctors are required to report any injury from animal bites to the authority the animal control required her to quarantine the pet for days my landlord first announced that she would have the pet euthanized right after the day quarantine and told us that she changed her mind few days afterwards possibly because of false fire alarm at am here is list of things our landlord has been doing that we had been suspecting to be illegal deceptive misleading advertising stating that the landlord would not be living in the house she claims that she was going to be traveling for work but then it just did not happen but found out from her linkedin that she knew she would be in town during the rental period enter tenant room without permission and bring in strangers to the house my partner and saw the landlord walking into our housemate room we were not sure if she had his permission and the landlord brainlessly texted our housemate about it too my landlord also brings in strangers in the house because it looks like she runs massage pseudoscience healing service at home and we were never informed of it refuse to provide me with copy of the lease by claiming that the electronic one which does not look like rental lease was sufficient yet she did ask my partner and the other tenant for signatures on printed copies of the leases which she said that she would use for her medical insurance we later spotted the copies at home with falsified dates under their signatures the dates were months earlier than the actual dates the tenants signed them suspect it to be for tax evasion purpose as the falsified dates happened to be earlier than the date she filed for an llc am the only foreign citizen and female among the tenants harassment my landlord had been acting in an aggressive manner especially after refused to speak with her in person because could no longer stand how rude she had been to me requested her to contact me via emails or texts and suggested her to keep the communication professional between landlord and tenants but she still forced me to speak with her in several occasions and even tried gaslighting me lying previously my landlord agreed to renew the lease for another months which was the reason for us to sign the lease with her too it is also noted on paper yet she claims that she did not remember at all it is an obvious lie because the printed copy with the note on it has always been on her desk take every request personally not only it took her more than months to have the fire alarms which rang times day fixed she responded rudely to many other requests too for example ma heat law requires the heat to be turned on and maintained at certain temperature from september there was no heat at all in the bathrooms all the way until november and it was because wrote in and quoted the state sanitary code to which she responded that she never had the heat on since she bought the house because they are energy hogs early morning noises she gets up at am each morning and chants loudly before and after am on saturdays and sundays she had been hosting online classes early in the morning too and only paused them after we complained about it regret not asking her to stop the nonsense earlier but we wanted to maintain good relationship when we enter the lease and wanted little more stability because moving around is just tiring anyone had similar experience with crazy landlord here appreciate any advice thank you,"Landlord rented out rooms in her house to two tenants.

we like to meet up sometime soon to put our heads together and put all of our evidence in one place for all of us to easily access like google drive folder or something ve always been kind of interested in labor laws so have little bit of knowledge already enough to recognize the red flags my boss has been raising in the past year but not going to claim that some expert or even well versed in this suppose what inquiring about is whether he truly violating any laws and what our next steps would be to do something about it if so bit of backstory work at franchised restaurant chain in ohio it small crew of mostly college aged people and the franchise owner is considered our boss but of course we have general manager as well all the chains in this area are owned by the same family so all of leadership is related here are the highlighted instances that we are taking note of as group instance we have evidence of our boss threatening to dock pay for bathroom breaks and that he would no longer be paying for closers staying past the scheduled end time of their shifts because he firmly believes getting out on time should not be difficult however he quickly backed off of these threats when one of my coworkers who no longer works here pointed out that he may get himself into legal trouble for doing this that was sort of the point that made us start paying attention to his actions instance do not think this is something that has happened to me but couple of my coworkers have claimed that their paychecks seem shorter than the hours they ve put in my boss defense for this when it was brought up by the assistant manager was that it against policy to pay overtime quote we do not do overtime here pretty sure federal law says he has to do overtime pay additionally pretty sure federal law says he has to pay for all hours worked by an employee regardless of whether they stayed over their written scheduled time there was recently time where my boss wife had just had baby and was spending extended time in the hospital so my coworker the assistant manager put in some extra time to cover his shifts so that he could be with his family after doing the math from her paystubs she pretty sure she was not fully compensated for that time instance the coworker who mentioned earlier the one who no longer works at our store was fired for getting arguably pretty mouthy with our boss over write up he was written up for closing the store couple minutes before scheduled closing time and he copped bit of an attitude for it so he was told that that would be his last day now the attitude definitely came from prior frustrations with our boss and it started pretty heated argument between the two at one point our boss put his hands on my ex coworker to push him out the door when he was refusing to leave before he could finish getting his point across ex coworker is now wondering if he was legally allowed to do that and not really sure myself instance this is the most recent one the assistant manager mentioned earlier was recently robbed and it had happened right before the beginning of the month when all her bills would be due so she asked for payroll advance while she tried to get things sorted out with the authorities boss gave it to her and then took all of it off her paycheck during the next pay cycle told her that was pretty sure he was not able to do that as that deduction would have resulted in her take home pay being less than the federal minimum hourly rate it was something like deduction from what would have been ish check however have also heard that payroll advances are an exception to wage garnishment laws not sure what true as cannot find any clear confirmation really appreciate anyone who still here lol and ll try to answer questions as best can if there are any this is all still in conversation with my coworkers and like said we re all in our early we do not really know much about labor laws lol appreciate anyone who has any further knowledge or advice to give also hope flared this right we re not in union but figured it was still the most fitting out of all the options,A group of young workers in Ohio are concerned that their boss is violating labor laws. The boss of a restaurant franchise has threatened to dock pay for bathroom breaks and has refused to pay overtime. They have also been accused of shortening paychecks.

as the title says wondering if party in the group can record therapy session without the knowledge of the other parties when we began the session the therapist said that the conversation was to be had in confidence but we ve found out that someone recorded the entire session know one party consent is all that needed in texas but was not sure if things changed in the context of therapy session,"A person in a therapy session recorded it without telling the other people in the group or the therapist, and they want to know if this is legal in Texas. 

Texas law does not single out therapy sessions for special rules regarding recording conversations, so the general law regarding party consent applies here. In Texas, only one party to a conversation needs to consent to recording it, so it is likely legal for the person who made the recording to do so without informing the others. However, the confidentiality agreement between the therapist and the patients may be breached by the recording person, which may have legal consequences."

Additionally, you can ask your bondsman for help. They may have received information from the court directly. Bonding companies often provide valuable assistance throughout the court process, so check with them regularly.

was hoping to be able to access my retirement account early since was disabled at work and do not have access to income and may not for some time was supposed to be vested earlier this year but the vesting stopped have not been at work for nearly two years and they cite that as the reason is that legal for them to stop vesting when would have been at work if they had not disabled me thanks,"You are likely entitled to unemployment benefits while you are unable to work due to your disability, but you will need to check the specific rules for your jurisdiction. 

As for your retirement benefits, the rules around vesting are specific to the terms of your employer's retirement plan and the laws of your state. That said, it is not necessarily illegal for your employer to stop vesting you in a retirement plan. The specifics depend on the language of the plan and possibly local laws. 

Unfortunately, I cannot offer specific legal advice regarding your retirement plan. I recommend consulting with a lawyer who specializes in this area to understand your rights and options. They will be able to review the details of your situation and provide accurate legal advice. 

In the meantime, you can support yourself by applying for disability benefits through social security if you qualify. You can also look into government assistance programs and nonprofit organizations that may be able to offer help while you recover."
we re in nc we were sued by contractor who walked off the job and he put lein on our house he has sued we officially responded to his suit with denials and sent counterclaim he responded with all denials we haven heard back from him since pretty sure the ball is in his court and mediation is the next step how long does he have to do something,"You filed a response to the lawsuit with denials and have filed a counterclaim against the contractor who put a lien on your house in North Carolina. Since you haven't heard back from him, it's likely the case is paused as you move into the mediation stage. It's possible the contractor is waiting for mediation deadlines to approach before responding. You can contact the court to ensure all documents are in order and to check on the status of your case. 

It may be helpful to reach out to the contractor directly and ask about the status of the case and if they plan on responding to your counterclaim. Even if you are frustrated with their work and communication, it is best to remain professional and courteous when communicating with them. This will help preserve your credibility with the court in the event the case does go to trial."

Her employer has kept in touch with her throughout, but they do not have a position for her anymore since she never officially started. 

It might be worth consulting with an attorney to determine whether your wife's case constitutes wrongful termination, particularly if you deem it prudent to proceed with a lawsuit. An attorney would likely advise you to gather all correspondence with your wife's former employer to bolster any possible case. 

Ultimately, wrongful termination suits can be complicated, and the details of your wife's case will factor into any possible course of action. It's advisable to consult with an attorney to assess the cost-benefit of pursuing legal action against her former employer."

Given that you didn't violate any traffic laws, it's possible it was sent to you in error. It's also possible that the mistake was made by the court, not the police. It is advised that you attend the court date, but if you cannot, it is possible that appearing at a later date with the correct information may prevent any issues. 

It is unlikely that officers will arrest you with only a warrant for your first name, as warrants typically include identifiers beyond just a name. However, you should still address the situation as soon as possible to avoid misunderstanding. 

Are you in the US? If so, I recommend that you contact a legal professional versed in traffic law to assist you in navigating this situation.

we broke our lease in new jersey because we found house and put bid in and things moved very quickly we asked if we could get our security deposit back and they initially said yes but then backtracked and said we lied about the timeline and that they thought the move would be closer to the end of the lease all communication happened through our real estate agent who was acting as the owner representative she always said the landlord was too busy to talk to us but he was cc on the emails we moved at the end of the month and found some friends who wanted to move in on the first of the month but the real estate agent said they wanted to paint so they had to wait until mid month they re now refusing to refund our security deposit even though someone else moved in and is paying rent is this legal simply because we broke the lease suspect it may be but we were not sure and the real estate agent is just nasty whenever we contact her,"You broke your lease in New Jersey and initially were told you would get your security deposit back, but the landlord is now refusing to return it citing that you lied about the timeline of your move and that they believed you would vacate closer to the end of your lease. You moved out at the end of the month and arranged for your friends to move in at the start of the next month, however, the real estate agent claimed painting was needed and your friends couldn't move in until mid-month. 

Is this legal? It depends on the terms of your lease and the laws of New Jersey, but it is possible your landlord may be in violation. I would recommend consulting with a lawyer and perhaps also a different real estate agent who can assist you in discussing this with the landlord and reaching a resolution.

hey everyone so my dad has not payed cent of child support in years he is currently over in debt for child support he works under the table so as far as know they cant take the money from his paychecks because of this grew up poor my mom is single mom and is always working to make sure she can afford food and rent growing up all ive ever known was struggling missed out on so much due to our financial situation and now im worried about how will afford college would it be all possible to sue my father for the money he owes in child support id be able to use it to pay for college and give my mom the rest of the money left over from that thank you,"You and your mother could consult a family law attorney about suing your father for back child support. It might be possible to file a lawsuit against him in civil court rather than pursuing the matter through the office of Child Support Enforcement (CSE). In the US, CSE offices typically only get involved when enforcing current child support, not back support.

my wife was victim of sex trafficking ring one of the criminals had public defender that public defender became judge when my wife went to court for custody of her two daughters that person happened be the judge my wife wasn able to secure an attorney in time for court it was months in to the custody case so she went to court to ask for continuance she needed little more time to get enough money together witch she was very close in doing so when the day of court she asked for the continuation the judge denied her of the extra time then the fathers lawyer got to go ahead with the case he lied up and down and she was powerless to defend her self so the father was granted everything he wanted is that something that is legal for judge to do,"A person who was representing the father of my wife's children in a custody case was a public defender who used to represent my wife's sex trafficking ring boss. My wife didn't have legal representation against this person, who is now a judge, and the judge denied her request for a continuance to give her time to raise money for legal fees. 
The father's lawyer lied in court and she lost custody of her children. 

Is this legal? 

It is certainly possible that what happened to your wife was illegal and unconstitutional and violates her rights in several ways, and you may be able to appeal this decision or pursue other legal remedies. It is impossible for me to say with certainty without knowing more details about the case, the exact procedures that were followed, and the applicable laws. 

It is fundamental to the justice system in many countries, including the United States, that individuals have the right to legal representation and a fair trial. This includes the right to request a continuance in order to prepare for court proceedings. 

It is possible that this judge has violated your wife's rights by denying her request for a continuance and by allowing the other party's lawyer to lie in court."

was sexually assaulted as child for several years eventually telling my mom when was it was my step father and wit the threat of death hanging over my head it wasn like was jumping to tell everyone naturally mom takes me to the police was get sexual assault kit done do the interview and things move relatively quickly all things considered was thinking this was going to be months long thing before they ever talked to him but they showed up at my house two hours later asking to talk and the next day admit everything fast forward about months into the future there like some charges because the prosecutor is charging him for each seperate time she proceeds to tell my mom and that it would probably be better idea to agree to plea deal for him because while we had the physical evidence for this most recent assault the defense could make reasonable argument about the times was younger which could end up non guilty verdict all together not really understanding the law ourselves and not wanting to drag my younger siblings into trial nor wanting to tell the story all over again we agreed no the original sentencing with his charges and the time expected to serve was about years for what he was charged with and in the state where from if you re charged with violent sexual offense you re not supposed to be able to get good time obviously had severe mental health issues after this in and out of hospitals and on meds and none of this sat right with my mom so we do some digging with an independent lawyer and he like really you could hold him responsible for the mental anguish you went through and he could be held financially responsible for those bills at the time said no because he was in jail he was going to be there long time and that was fine with me skip forward few years and get call saying he eligible for parole the fick you mean he only be in prison for years so we go back to the independent lawyer and he says did they explain this to you at all and we shook our heads basically there was fine print that he would be eligible for good time and they conviently left that out again didn want to dwell on it too much but now at the age of almost get call saying he will soon be rwalsed from jail which has naturally caused need for more therapy as get older and the more think about it like you know he absolutely should be held accountable since the legal system did shit job of that he sat in prison cells for ish years but got to go to college free mental health care and out here having to take meds and basically hold my shit together so he doesn see how badly this broke me is there time limit on being able to guess it would be sue for all the therapy bills was the lawyer even right which have seen it where sexual assault victims do get money from abusers but it always been on tv so don know how difficult it actually is to do,"You can sue your step-father for the emotional pain he caused you, and possibly recover the cost of therapy. Since he has been in prison, he hasn't been able to earn an income, but upon his release he may resume earning wages.

ve been an hr professional for almost years and recently joined new company they say that an offer letter is legal document and because of that legal has the right to dictate everything in the offer letter and must sign off in my previous years of experience hr would dictate the offer letters and if any one off situations came up we would consult with legal to get their advice and then we would decide how best to use this verbiage any time push back on legal like the un friendly verbiage to the offer letter the paragraphs of information vs bullet points etc they say it is legal document so stop asking to change it helpful to note we have new hires sign confidentiality agreements that contains non compete clauses this is legal document can legal attorney with experience in employment law tell me if an offer letter that contains an at will statement visibly present is indeed legal document or am right in that it is not legal document since they make no promises of future employment,"You are correct that offer letters are not legal documents in and of themselves. Offer letters are more of a formality and reflect the terms of employment a company would like to extend to a candidate. They are not binding contracts and can't be used in court to enforce promises of employment. 

However, certain clauses in offer letters can create legal issues if not handled properly. For example, at-will statements and non-compete agreements can be included in offer letters, but they must be written clearly and concisely to be enforceable. It's always a good idea to have an attorney review offer letters to ensure compliance with relevant employment laws and to mitigate risk. 

It is also worth noting that the nature of the offered role and its responsibilities may also determine the necessary legal precautions your offer letter should include, so consult an attorney near you for specific advice."

so have phone plan why my ex boyfriend yeah know stupid idea he hasn paid his phone bill in phones and so shut down his account now wondering since he hasn been paying can take it to court to recoup loses or is it lost money at this point unfortunately don think we have contract stating they ll pay me directly but they are on my account would the court see it in my favour or would just be wasting my time,"You may be able to take your ex-boyfriend to small claims court to recoup the money he owes you for his share of the phone plan since you both signed onto the account agreement.

However, you are concerned that the police may revisit the situation given the conflicting accounts of her condition from witnesses at the bar."
we have house that sits bit far back from the street so we have pretty long flat paved driveway we moved in shortly before the pandemic and never met any of our neighbors or their kids over the past couple months several grade school kids have started using our driveway for scootering periodically from the end of our driveway right up to the front door ve never talked to these kids to say ok or not ok and do not know who their parents are thinking they re here because our driveway might be somehow safer than the sidewalks also flat and wide now that it getting wet out we have puddles and some moss growing in our driveway that we usually just let run the course until it dies in the summer are we exposing ourselves to liability by not kicking the kids off our driveway if it matters we legally own the whole driveway but we share it with one house that has an easement we know these neighbors quite well this house has new year old driver we re located in oregon,"Children in your neighborhood have started using your driveway to scooter, likely because it is safer than the sidewalk. However, you are concerned about liability issues and the condition of your driveway. It is important to be aware of potential liability concerns, but you are not responsible for the children's behavior as long as you don't actively encourage dangerous behavior. 

To address the moss and puddles in your driveway, you can hire a pressure washing service to clean the driveway and remove any safety hazards. Regularly cleaning the driveway will also help prevent future moss growth. 

It might also be worth your time to reach out to the parents of the children to open a line of communication. 

Are there any other actions you are considering taking?"
to start do not really have question besides can call the police about this best advice is always appreciated if have lawsuit please let me know the son of family friend and decided to room together and signed lease with his father as the rd party co signer guess he pays the rent in full and pay my half to him we moved in on novo and all was well the next day was hospitalized for mental health condition upon release returned to the house lease had been signed and finalized on zillow to find the father and backup there to force me out of the house and hand over his keys after hours of trying to talk some sense into him he told me he would change the locks and call the police police came and held onto the keys but left for the night to give him and his son my roommate no issues the next day was told by the parents that the locks had been changed the lease rewritten and that was not welcome back days later today spoke to the landlord who said he did not know if the locks had actually been changed but did say that the lease had been cancelled and rewritten was not notified of this and did not consent to it still want to work things out with the family and move back in with the help of local law enforcement if need be or be financially compensated for the treatment received is it legal to rewrite the lease like that thank you big time currently street vibin these past few nights,"You signed a lease with a roommate and his father cosigned. The father wants you out and has told you that the lease has been rewritten and locks changed. You were not notified of this and want to know if this is legal and if you can take any action. 
You are currently homeless as a result. 

Please seek legal advice from an actual lawyer, as my responses are not a substitute for professional legal counsel.

so was selling car on payments to someone while they use it they decided to only give me out of cant report it stolen they will not respond or give the car back and cannot find them or the car someone else wants to buy it they know what going on so my question is if the person who wants to buy it does are they able to report it stolen since they did not give them permission to use the car please tell me someone has good news for me,"You sold a car to someone on payment plans. The buyer failed to make payments and failed to return the car. The buyer allegedly misrepresented themselves as the new owner of the car to a third party, who now wants to buy the car from them. 

Is the third party able to report the car as stolen if they did not give the initial buyer permission to use the car? 

It is unclear if the third party can report the car as stolen. It is up to the police to determine if the situation constitutes theft or fraud.  It is likely the police will investigate the situation and determine who has ownership stake in the car, likely through examining titles and purchase agreements. 

In the future, it is important to secure legal forms when entering an agreement to sell a vehicle to another person. This may include drafting a purchase agreement and securing a legal title to the vehicle."
texas husband and were temporarily living with my dad and older brother and my husband had moved out for about week because we were verbally arguing lot he wanted to come by and get some clothes and when he did he and my brother started fighting outside my brother and husband have never gotten along my brother beat my husband badly and wouldn stop punching him even after he passed out my husband didn fight back because he was blindsided by the attack was witness and so was friend of mine called the police they showed up but didn arrest my brother they brought my husband to the hospital where he stayed for days and then was released when the police showed up the lieutenant actually fist bumped my brother and told him nice work my brother told the police that he was defending me because my husband hit me but when the police looked me over had no marks or bruises told the police that that was untrue as did my friend my husband didn put his hands on me and my husband was not arrested my brother is on felony probation in the same county and feel like he should be charged for what he did what direction does my husband and go from here,"Your brother attacked your husband when he came over to pick up his clothes while you two were living with your dad and brother. Your brother punched your husband so hard that he passed out and continued punching him even after he was unconscious. The police did not arrest your brother despite him being on felony probation. You believe your brother attacked your husband in order to protect you, but there were no signs of you being attacked as you claim your husband did not lay a hand on you. 

What can you do next? It would be best to consult with a criminal defense attorney and consider filing a police report to document the attack, potentially pressing charges yourself against your brother if your husband is unwilling or unable to do so. Your husband could also file a restraining order against your brother to prevent any future attacks."

Since you've since learned she is not trustworthy, you wish to recover this sum without causing issues. You are unsure of how to proceed and consider whether you should engage a lawyer. 

Would you like me to help you draft a request to your sister for the return of the money? Or would you like me to help you look for lawyers in your area whom you could consult for advice? 

I'm sorry to hear about your dad and the situation you're in. It's good that you've become aware of your sister's character and are looking to take steps to protect yourself. It's always advisable to be cautious when handling financial matters, especially when large sums of money are involved. 

It would be helpful to know where you're located (country and state) as laws vary depending on the jurisdiction. Would you be able to share that information? 

Moreover, it would also be good to know the exact amount of money involved, the terms of the inheritance, and whether your sister has admitted to wrongdoing or given any reason for her actions (such as her own financial difficulties)."

An attorney can also advise you on possible legal remedies or options you may have available to you, such as refinancing your mortgage or filing a lawsuit against the mortgage company for any wrongdoing. 

It may also be beneficial to seek financial advice from a mortgage expert or counselor to review your mortgage terms, payments, and determine if you qualify for any assistance or lower interest rates. They can also provide you with information and resources to help you navigate the process of refinancing your mortgage or finding a more suitable repayment plan. 

It's important to note that the specifics of your case may vary depending on the laws and regulations of your location. It is highly recommended that you consult with legal and financial professionals who can provide personalized advice and guidance based on your circumstances."
so my neighbor is the grumpiest old dude that ve ever met in my life my husband and have had several unsavory interactions with him over the past few weeks and yikes this guy is different we bought our home here oregon in he been here his whole life from my understanding anywho this started because of fence this neighbor lot and ours is separated by fence that has been there for many years and was apparently built by this guy family back in the day not only was it an absolute eye sore but he had stuff leaning against his side which caused it to lean inwards rendering sections of the fence unusable by us as we couldn construct something that was meant to sit flush with the fence we first approached him about this year ago we were extremely kind and understanding with this situation and had only ever had pleasant yet short interactions prior first we let him know that it was an issue and that we be more than happy to help him fix the fence he seemed open to doing something about this and said he had plan to fix it fast forward months nothing has been done have bad temper so my husband was able to handle the friendly check ins with the neighbor he approached him again and the neighbor pretty much gave him the same story albeit was not as friendly this go round said he get to it in few weeks our approach has always been to offer him help in fixing it and we meant that fast forward another months we re hoping to build something that sits against that area of the fence and still cannot husband goes over third time with an ask for specific timeline for it to be fixed neighbor responds gruffly that he needs two weeks something of note over the course of the year ve completely landscaped the back yard myself it taken hundreds of hours and lot of to do it and so pleased with how it looks and feels we love to have company love plants and nature so having beautiful eclectic yard it was dead patch of grass before really means lot to me the remaining issue is this eyesore of fence that also prohibits us from using part of our side yard back to the interaction again two weeks later neighbor comes over to let us know that he found contractor who going to be replacing the middle section of the fence the fence has about segments to it middle are to be replaced we re so appreciative that this is the chosen option and agree to pay half since we re both planning to split the cost ask to speak with the contractor to better understand the scope of the work and want to have him complete the remaining two segments of the fence that the neighbor doesn plan to have swapped out they re old and roughly feet taller than the new fence on our dime we also offered to so this without the contractor having to go over to his side of the property furthermore we were hosting an event in our yard on the day he set the contractor for when we asked for modicum of collaboration on this questions like can we speak with the contractor to better understand the scope and details of the project we like to have him complete the first and last segments of the fence so it continuous from end to end neighbor immediately shuts down going so far as to simply not provide the contact info for the contractor and refuse to allow us to adjust the date so it works for both parties he then just tells us he going to pay for it himself this is how much it was worth to him not to work together in any way didn push back at this point because he wasn allowing us to be involved in any of the decisions at all but never even suggested that we wouldn pay unless he did certain things he just straight up told us he was going to pay for the whole thing everything has been so awkward he incredibly unfriendly and fully opposed to working together for mutually beneficial outcome despite our best efforts to be understanding and working towards common benefit have never in my life interacted with person like him stubborn non collaborative uncaring unfriendly the list of unsavory descriptors goes on anywho contractor comes on the day set by the neighbor and does great job with the middle sections of the fence neighbor tells us not to touch our use the new fence for anything on our side no bird houses nada fine send thank you to the neighbor and pull the contractor aside to plan project to complete the first and last segments to we have an actually continuous fence from one end to the other it makes literally no sense to do this any other way and again we were planning to pay for the replacement of both remaining sections while not asking for the neighbor to move anything or be concerned with the process in any way proceed to tell the neighbor that we re going to complete the fence and he asks to speak he ends up meeting with my husband and the contractor last week and vehemently opposes the replacement of the first and last segments even though we will pay for it and he does not need to lift finger as part of the process he goes on to say that he doesn care that they re different and he doesn care that it matters to us he just doesn care what anyone else thinks and it was fence that his family built and it been there forever my husband is literal social worker and could not get this guy to be reasonable or make any sense essentially he fully shut down our effort to complete the fence end to end so we are having to jerry rig different solution that going to look like much more of patch job than if we were able to just do the exact same thing that was done by the contractor weeks prior lose it at this point ve been holding back my feelings on this for over year because don want bad dynamic with the people live next to we otherwise have very nice relationships with people on the block go over to speak with him since missed the meeting and he tells me to come over the next day at noon but he not going to change his mind next day go over not to yell and scream but to level with this person from the standpoint of being decent collaborative neighbors who work towards common benefit on both sides of the fence he literally tells me that he does not care at all what we want or that the fence is non continuous he not here to make any friends and doesn care to work with us at all actually couldn even get to the point of yelling his perspective was so mind boggling to me that was dumbfounded and strong debater and mediator in tough conversations he doesn care about us our desire to complete the fence it been there for long time his family built it he doesn want to talk about it anymore he doesn care that we would bear the full financial and work burden of replacing it from our side without asking him to lift finger goodbye he also wouldn allow us to bring his taller fence to the same height as the new fence the remaining sections are taller so if we reface the old fence will still be way higher in parts than the new fence he doesn know what will happen to it if we do it tell him we re going to still modify our face of the remaining segments so we can achieve some modicum of continuity aesthetics are important to me and even so this is still going to look like patch job was pretty depressed for the rest of the day this is not the relationship want with the person who lives next to us while don get the sense that he resentful just devoid of humanity am at this point we have plan to reface our side however starting to dig into other options regarding properly lines sounds like there are no formal properly lines recorded by the county for our lots but there are huge metal stakes sticking out of the ground that was told are property markers they re very old there are two on our side of the fence with another neighbor and one that can see between problem neighbor and our lot the marker is on his side by about inches don see second one from my cursory look but it possible that the fence has always been to ft into our lot if can prove this preferably without having to hire surveyor technically the fence is on our property and we can do whatever we want with it except in oregon there law called acquiring title by adverse possession which apparently grants ownership to someone who has been using section of neighboring property if certain criteria are met my plan is to speak with the county about this to get more info on property boundary demarkation and this law and to proceed from there aside from just dropping it what would you do or suggest at this point,"You and your husband have had several unpleasant interactions with your neighbor regarding fixing a fence between your properties. Your neighbor becomes angry when you ask to speak with the contractor he hires to fix the fence. He tells you he does not want to work with you and does not care about your desires. 

You investigate the possibility that the fence was built encroaching on your property. You plan to speak with the county about property boundary demarcation and a law in Oregon about acquiring ownership of a section of a neighbor's property. 

What would you like advice or suggestions on?"

my now ex fianc and called off our wedding plans about year ago we had venue booked for our wedding date which was obviously canceled the terms of the contract state that should the event be called off we may still owe up to of the original price for the venue even if the date was rebooked which it has been that date is now also months passed in our last conversation with the event planner we were told they may be able to lower the amount owed to the venue since they were able to rebook since then we have not heard anything back after reaching out though email multiple times am not sure how to move forward because according to our contract this money is technically still owed and it seems odd that the planner would not respond when we are literally trying to give them money does this contract become void at any point due to lack of correspondence from the venue any insight on this situation would be appreciated,"You and your ex-fiancé booked a venue for your wedding which you later cancelled. The venue has rebooked your original date but is claiming you still owe them part of the original fee stated in the contract you signed. You have tried to reach out to the venue via email multiple times since then, but they have not responded. 

Is the contract null and void if a business does not respond to attempts to settle on a compromise? 

You are looking for advice on how to proceed."

in ford opened their ordering for highly popular maverick trucks and my father placed custom order for truck through our local well known ford dealership indiana want to point out that he also had family discount code from family member worth approximately off the truck throughout he was constantly checking in with dealer for updates on production status of his custom purchase order in july he was told by the dealer that ford would most likely not get his truck produced by time they were ready to start versions and he should also get on the order list for version in case my father was upset since the color he wanted wasn availability in the model and the truck was more expensive which he expressed to the dealer but still ordered recently my father contacted ford directly to check order status and was informed his truck had been built and delivered to the indiana dealership wks prior he had never received any notification from the dealership or ford directly he contacted the dealership and found out they had already sold his truck since he had ordered so the figured he would want that one instead does he have any legal recourse on this of course the dealer would have sold it for more money than they were getting from my father due to the family discount and high demand was the dealer legally obligated to notify him his custom order had arrived prior to immediately selling to someone else what is his best course of action now,"A customer ordered a discounted Maverick truck from a Ford dealership in Indiana, specifying a particular color scheme that was not available on the version of the truck that was set to start production. 

The customer was informed that their order might not arrive in time to be produced at the factory, but was never informed that their custom order had arrived at the dealership. 

Upon learning that the truck had in fact been produced and delivered to the dealership, the customer also learned that the truck had immediately been sold to another buyer, as the dealership had never notified the customer of the truck's arrival. 

Since the dealership sold the truck at a profit without notifying the customer, who had ordered the truck with a family discount, it is likely that the customer could have legal recourse against the dealership for failing to uphold their contractual obligations. 

It is recommended that the customer consults with a legal professional to explore their best course of action, which may include contractual remedies."
inherited an antique long rifle octagonal barrel unsure of the exact length manufactured before as far as can tell and would like to bring it to my home in nyc as far as can tell this should count as an antique firearm which does not require registration already own it so it not purchase and it was manufactured before which means it not required to have serial number it single shot rifle the bore may or may not be diameter that could accommodate modern cartridge not sure however the nyc specific laws ve found regarding antique firearms only describe pistols or revolvers and do not address long guns given that new york city seems to enjoy abusing law abiding citizens looking for some clarification from someone who actually knows the law please no speculative responses thanks in advance,"I would like to bring an antique rifle I inherited to NYC, but I am unsure if it is legal to do so. According to my research, it should be considered an antique firearm and thus exempt from registration requirements. However, NYC laws regarding antique firearms seem to only refer to pistols and revolvers. 

Can you please provide legal clarity on whether I can bring my rifle to NYC, or if there is any legal risk in doing so? 

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide."

Now, the homeowner faces paying twice for the same materials. Filing a lien against his property could negatively affect the homeowner's credit. 

Homeowners who hire contractors bear some responsibility for ensuring that the contractor pays everyone involved in a job. Homeowners can protect themselves from liens by asking for a lien waiver from the contractor and any suppliers or subcontractors before paying the final invoice."

This harassment intensified to the point where the target was informed that they would be jumped by the friend group on Monday. They plan to fight back but fear the consequences. 

Would a restraining order be possible in this scenario? 

[Restraining order is a legal measure to prevent harassment or threat of harm. It establishes a boundary between the person obtaining the order and the person deemed to be a threat, to protect the targeted person from further harassment or injury.] 

This scenario could result in a restraining order, especially if the person who fears being jumped records the threats and reports the incident to the school or police. 

A restraining order is a legal tool to prevent harassment or threats of harm, and the implicated actions in this situation qualify as such. The person who fears being jumped should collect evidence of the threats and any other actions constituting harassment, and then consult with the school or police to obtain a restraining order against the person who is harassing them."

You could also write your congressional representative to ask for assistance in getting reimbursed for your legal fees. You could also contact veteran's services to see if there are any state-level benefits you could claim. 

It might also be worthwhile to attend counseling to help you deal with the emotional trauma you experienced.

my ex moved out few months ago and everything seemed fine he actually said he was much happier on his own and he knew was in new relationship he then met someone of his own and thought this would be amicable well his relationship did not last and now he is living with his mom he travels for work so living is loosely defined he told me last night that he plans to take our two kids and move them in with his mother have two older kids from previous relationship and minnesota has been their home almost entirely for one and completely for the other years suspect it is the fact that he with his mom that he suddenly feels soft to pose this his mom is wealthy and will likely pay for the lawyer,"My ex wants to take our kids away from me and move in with his mother, who is wealthy and will likely fund the endeavour. He has already moved out and lives a nomadic life for work, bouncing around between jobs. He has two older children from a previous relationship and wants to move our younger kids in with his mom in Minnesota, where they primarily reside already. 

Is there anything I can do to stop this from happening, potentially legally? 

I suspect his motive is that he now has access to his mom's wealth and resources and now he wants to try and have access to our kids' lives in order to exert more control and have a bigger influence on them, taking advantage of a situation where he can afford to take them away and take them from me. 

Is there any legal recourse I can take to stop this from happening or to mitigate the damage if it does happen?"

according to rcw when property is sold to new landlord the new landlord is required to provide the tenant with the name and address of the financial institution where the the deposit is being held we were not provided this information and now that we ve vacated the property we re facing issues with getting our deposit back while the code clearly states what the landlord is required to do it doesn give any information regarding the consequences of not doing so can anyone clarify what the repercussions are for the landlord in such situation,"In Washington state, if a landlord sells a property, they are required to inform their tenant of the name and address of the financial institution where the security deposit is being held. Failing to do so may result in complications for the tenant when they vacate the property and subsequently attempt to recover their deposit. 

It is important to note that the law specifies the action required of the landlord in this situation, but does not detail the repercussions for failing to comply. 

To obtain further information regarding the consequences for the landlord, it is recommended to consult with a legal professional or conduct additional research on Washington state landlord-tenant laws."

hello all have problem with my neighbor tenant driving too fast over shared driveway the driveway is on my property but my neighbor has an ingress egress easement his tenant also uses the driveway but drives dangerously fast have spoken to my neighbor and asked if the tenant would slow down nothing has happened since the driveway is on my property can prohibit the tenant from using the easement driveway thanks in advance the property is kentucky,"You can't unilaterally prohibit your neighbor's tenant from using the easement, but you can install speed bumps on your property to control the speed of vehicles using the driveway. You should speak with a local attorney to understand your rights and obligations regarding the easement and your options for enforcing the easement rights. 
It is also advisable to speak with your neighbor again and inform them of your intention to install speed bumps and request that their tenant drives safely over your property. 

You may also want to consult with a local attorney to determine if there are any other legal remedies available to you under Kentucky law. 

It is important to note that laws regarding easements, property rights, and tenant behavior can vary depending on the state and local regulations, so it is always best to consult with legal professionals who are familiar with the laws in your area."

for several months complained in writing about my neighbor making threats and ve sent video to the landlord of the neighbor making threats the last email sent to my ll about this was last friday and the next day my neighbors saw me in the hallway and jumped me with her friend days prior had to file an incident report because someone tried to break into my unit also found out the neighbor who jumped me is friends with someone who does security and that friend that does security is related to one of the people that help manage the building one day the security just stood there and let the girl curse me out making threats at my doorstep came into the rental office week after that incident to talk with management the lady speaking to me was trying to hold in laugh while interacting with me as if that argument was funny this is the one who related to security when told police what happened they made it seem like should be the one to move when the neighbor is the one causing trouble never left sooner because thought the issue would be resolved without me having to move it seems like the harassing neighbor gets to just mess with people because she single mom who well acquainted with the building staff am leaving regardless because it not safe but does she really get to stay there after jumping me with her friend never interacted with the girl she has mental problem always yelling in her unit about beating people up so no did not play role in agitating her,"Your neighbor, who has been making threats and attempting to break into your unit, jumped you with her friend after you complained to your landlord about these incidents.

Since the business is struggling, you're wondering if there is any way to reduce or delay what you owe. You've had no luck reaching attorneys. 

Did you seek advice from a CPA or accounting professional? They could help you find a way to negotiate with the IRS or find a repayment plan that works for you. 

It might also be worth reaching out to multiple attorneys rather than just two. Attorneys are often very busy and may not be able to take on new clients. If you have trouble reaching them by phone, try emailing them. 

I'm so sorry for your loss and for the difficulty you are having with the business."

my husband picked up his son from school on weekend that wasn his even though they share joint custody he was arrested on misdemeanor abduction charge his wife just got great job offer that requires us to move out of the state the judge had told him not to leave the state while this is going on his hearing isn until january th will we be able to get permission to leave the state as long as he shows for his court dates,"Your husband was arrested for abducting his son despite having joint custody. He was told by a judge not to leave the state until a hearing in January. Can you move out of state with your husband despite the custody agreement and his legal situation? 

It is important that you speak with a lawyer as soon as possible to understand the implications of your husband's arrest on your ability to move out of state and to receive custody arrangements. 

It is impossible for me to provide specific legal advice regarding your situation, and custody agreements can be very complex. It would be in your best interest to consult with a lawyer as soon as possible to determine your best course of action."
got my professional licensure which is very important in my field months ago my firm reimbursed me the cost of the exams about they have clause in the handbook that stipulates if you leave within years of being reimbursed for exams you will need to pay that back when put in my two weeks notice they informed me that my last paycheck is to have deducted from it realize the policy is on the handbook but is the policy itself legal could really use that money as moving for the new job and will have bit of gap between paychecks was aware of the policy and expecting this to happen but just now starting to realize it seems little off for an employer to do this so figured make sure have no recourse here,"You recently quit your job and gave your two-week notice. Your former employer reimbursed you for licensing exams required for your job several months ago. Upon termination of your employment, your employer reminded you about a handbook clause that states you must repay the exam reimbursement if you leave within a certain time frame. They also informed you that your final paycheck will be deducted to settle this debt. You're aware of the policy but want to know if this type of policy is legal. 

It is entirely legal for employers to include a repayment clause for exam reimbursements in an employee handbook or employment contract, and many companies do. Whether or not deductions from your final paycheck to recoup the expense of your exam reimbursement is permissible depends on the state you live in and the circumstances of your departure. 

States vary in their legislation of this practice. Some states, like California, prohibit employers from making deductions from final paychecks altogether. Others might allow deductions but could have laws regarding how much an employer can deduct or specify that deductions must be voluntary. 

If you're unsure if your state permits this type of deduction, consult with an attorney or tax professional for guidance specific to your location."
wanted to know if could get any insight to how broad copyright laws are specifically automotive brands part of small honda fan community and have found others who are reproducing honda vinyl decals for vehicles that are otherwise no longer in production they do not seem to be getting the whip cracked on them by honda so wondering if they are just doing it illegally or on such small scale that honda does not care the reason ask this is because have designed badge version of these decals that are similar to the modern automotive badging style you see on any newer car really like to start selling these as an alternative to the factory vinyl decals but do not want to get wrapped up in copyright infringement should mention that these vehicles are no longer in production it not like printing the honda line up badges in direct competition to honda would be in the clear because what created is totally unique and not offered currently on the market not even by honda would the best course of action be to reach out to someone at honda to see if can get written permission to continue with my plan to sell perhaps so long as they receive portion of the sales like licensing deal just find it hard to believe they ll want anything to do with me if only going to maybe make few hundred bucks like said just want to live forward in legitimate manner maybe there some loophole the vinyl decal makers on etsy know that do not appreciate any and all feedback,"You wish to produce and sell vinyl decals with a badge design similar to those produced by Honda, but want to avoid copyright infringement. Since Honda does not appear to pursue hobbyists who produce and sell similar products, you wonder if there is a loophole.

have relative that passed away at the beginning of the year the year prior to her death she mailed me her signed pink slip along with little letter stating that if anything happened to her that the car was mine when she passed went and picked up the vehicle and immediately registered it to my name and insured it now my bio dad is saying that what did was illegal and have to give the car back to him as he is next of kin do was it illegal,"A relative passed away and left a car to me in a letter. I have since registered and insured the car in my name, but the deceased's biological father claims I owe him the car as he is the next of kin. 

Was what I did illegal? 

It is difficult for me to provide precise legal advice regarding your situation, as laws may vary depending on your state or locality. 

In general, how the vehicle should be transferred upon someone's death will depend on the existence of a will and the terms of the will, or state law if there is no will. 

It is possible that the father believes he has a legal claim to the vehicle because he is the next of kin. However, this does not necessarily mean that he has legal ownership of the vehicle. It is important to carefully review the laws of your state to better understand how property is transferred upon death. 

To resolve this matter and determine the legal owner of the vehicle, you may want to consider speaking with an attorney and providing them with details about where you live, the existence of a will, and the terms of the will (if applicable)."
how is this different than bankruptcy proceeding assignee vs trustee obviously there no bankruptcy discharge what the strategy behind using this legal device would it be normal for creditors to actually have their attorneys file notices of appearances in addition to filing proof of claim,"A bankruptcy trustee and assignee both play roles in administering a bankruptcy estate. The trustee is appointed by the court and responsible for managing the estate, protecting assets, and distributing funds to creditors. An assignee is appointed by creditors and has more limited powers, primarily focused on realizing the assets of the debtor for the benefit of creditors. Creditors typically hire attorneys to file notices of appearance and proof of claim to ensure their rights are protected and to maximize their recovery from the bankruptcy estate. The use of an assignee instead of a trustee is less common and may be driven by specific legal or strategic considerations."

greetings from germany during the past days ve been researching how to legally post covers on youtube there has been somewhat contradicting information so like to ask whether got things right so far like to use the original recording of song and put my own vocals on top plan to post it to youtube only if correct need the following licenses mechanical license since create an own recording synch license since post on youtube master license since use the original recording as backing track is this correct some sources advocate that you can get away without the mechanical synch license due to youtube content id but cannot you still get into trouble because the automatic process will not catch every copyright breach so your video might still stay online while technically violating the copyright law appreciate any insight on this topic,"You need a mechanical license if you want to record a song and release it publicly, a synch license to post it on YouTube, and a master license if you use the original recording as a backing track. There seems to be a dispute over whether you need a synch license as YouTube Content ID may exempt you from needing one, however, it is best to stay protected and obtain one anyway to avoid any potential copyright breaches."
texas usa was surveying property for someone when came across car older mercedes owner of property had no idea it was there and that could keep it car is running perfectly and had the keys still in the ignition obviously there is no title registration or any sort of paperwork the vin comes out as clean not stolen there is mississippi state registration sticker on the windshield but unable to see what year it from the plates on the car are mismatched and show up as being some ford looked up the vin of said ford and it also shows as clean any options besides scrapping the car it was free so can lose either way but it running perfectly and quick little thing so ideally would want to keep it and be able to use it on public roads from my limited googling basically completely out of luck with zero documentation of any kind,"I found a car on a property I was surveying in Texas, USA. The car is a old Mercedes and the owner of the property doesn't have any documentation for the car, nor does it appear to be stolen according to the VIN. It runs well, but the plates don't match the car and I can't tell from the Mississippi sticker how old the registration is. 

Any way to legally keep the car and drive it? 

Edit: The car is in Texas, USA."
shady mil my mother in law venmos my husband usually multiple times per week and has him meet her at an atm withdraw the money and then give it back to her it large amounts like time something is definitely off why cannot she withdraw her own money instead of sending it to my husband this has been going on for few years how would that paper trail benefit her she does have trust fund from her mother dying few years back taxes something else she has previous fraud charges and felony charges for writing bad checks do not want her shady behavior to effect him sometime down the line any ideas am not in contact with my mil she absolutely hates me and is extremely toxic vindictive and manipulative which is completely besides the point but cannot just come out and ask her she would lie about it anyway,"Your husband's mother withdraws money from an ATM and then gives the money to your husband, who returns it to her. You think this is strange and worry that her previous criminal behavior and your lack of knowledge about why she does this may reflect badly on your husband someday. 

You are unsure why she does this but speculate that it benefits her in some way, possibly related to tax or trust fund issues. You are concerned that she is manipulating your husband and wish to avoid her behavior affecting him in the future. 

You do not want to confront her directly as she is toxic and you believe she would lie about her actions. 

You are looking for ideas about how to address this situation."
years old and have window cleaning business with my friend who is also the same age we started door knocking and for each house we split the pay however recently we knocked on door where person who owns hundreds of housing commissions in sydney decided to give us chance by cleaning the windows of her properties as the owner likes helping out young entrepreneurs like ourselves when this happened my friend called me and wanted to talk about pay change where he gets more as he feels he has brought more value to the company getting in contact with friends who are builders who need concrete removed from windows and selling more than me in terms of door knocking realised that this was true and was put in position where had to make big decision on the pay change of the company he would threaten me at any time that he would leave me and keep all the clients to himself as he was the main person in contact with them in the end ended up agreeing that he should get more since he is bringing more value to the company however the definition of partnership gets wonky here as made my first mistake of agreeing to receive however much he decides because at the end of the day he is my friend and had trust in him and also slipped up by agreeing that he owns the business because he thought of the idea of window cleaning however legally this is not true since own the abn admit to my mistakes but now it has come to the point where we have done our first job and the pay he has calculated equates to his way did not agree with this because he told me the way he calculated the pay was based on how much work did and with that property did more than half the work he is doing sneaky things like asking his friend who works in law to write up contract so everything is in order he told me about this and said nows the time to discuss what to have on the contract began by saying my ideas and then he switches up and says not here to negotiate he also tells me that he doesn want me to get more clients probably because he doesn want me to have leverage over him he also wants to pay me for all the money that we split investing in the company guess to try to clear my name from ever investing in it so he looks like the owner keep in mind that anytime disagree with anything he threatens to leave with all the clients who he has made great relationship with he then tells me that he has new way of calculating the pay which is by asking the business owner who owns all the housing commissions how much to pay me he kept threatening to leave me and that should go back to my so tried to save it by saying that transfer the abn to his name but having second thoughts and hard time putting all my trust in him don know what to do since do feel like am getting walked over but at the same time this is my only source of income but it isn for him so he has the power to bend my hand,You and your friend have started a window cleaning business where you split the pay for each job. Your friend threatens to leave the partnership and take all the clients with him after you land a job with a large property owner. He wants to change the pay structure to benefit him more since he brings in most of the clients. You agree to his terms since he has most of the leverage. He is drafting a contract for the business but tries to take more advantage by paying you however much he wants. You are worried he will try to take full ownership of the business.
sent an email to our landlord days prior to the lease end date stating that wanted to terminate our lease of one year and did not want to continue once it expired it would have automatically renewed into month to month which did not want it to become the termination clause states after expiration of the leasing period this agreement is automatically renewed from month to month but may be terminated by either party giving to the other day written notice of intention to terminate my interpretation of the termination clause is that the year long lease will be auto renewed into month to month if neither party gives any notice but if either party does give notice days prior to the lease end then the lease ends on the lease end date and it does not auto renew into month to month lease my landlord replied with the following our lease states that one month notice is required prior to moving out additionally our contract does not expire until sep therefore any notice of moving out should only be given once the contract term is complete our contract technically remains valid until the end of aug so we cannot return your security deposit to me it sounds like my landlord is saying that can only give notice after the contract expires but this does not make sense because then it sounds like tenants are being forced to pay an extra month worth of rent after year long lease ends unless am interpreting my landlord email or the termination clause incorrectly edit located in nyc,"You sent a notice to your landlord wanting to terminate your lease agreement which is set to expire in September. Your landlord claims you can only give notice once the contract term is complete, which would mean you'd have to pay an extra month's rent. You believe that you are correct in your interpretation of the lease termination clause."
my wife was walking the dog to the mailbox area of our townhomes but for some reason on the way back she left the dog off leash since it less than min walk back to our townhome there happens to be delivery driver walking back to his car in the opposite direction after dropping off our package according to my wife the dog started barking and she told the driver not to worry because the dog is all bark low and behold the dog ran up and nipped the driver at the leg my wife immediately apologized profusely and asked if the driver was ok the driver said he ok no problem and lift up his pants to check there was no puncture wound but the bite did break the skin and left what look like superficial scratch if that made sense there was blood but it looks like it from an abrasion if anything and not bleeding at all based on what she told me and all he would need is some washing some topical neosporin and bandaid she works in the medical field so would trust her assessment there then he just asked if the dog is fully vaccinated which she said yes and he said great and left on his way after that we went to go to dinner he came back later and left us note while we were out and asked us to call his supervisor mean think we are obviously in the wrong here since my wife left the dog off leash and we would do what would be needed to cover his potential medical bill but would we get in trouble or be liable or anything else was seeing some post about how they can sue us for as long as it break the skin and think that crazy amount if it just barely break the skin some other info dog is yo had her since she was months old no issue with other people and kids at the park etc ever we have toddler at home and she has been great with him all vaccinations are up to date last appointment was month ago do notice that my dog does not like hispanic or african male especially if they wear black or dark clothing but she just kind of growl at them at most and never done anything before not sure if this is her personality or some ptsd she had as we adopted her from the animal rescue group she loves female and would let any stranger pet her especially if they are female so what would we be liable for here would our home insurance covers the potential damage will we get visit from the police and our dog will get labeled as dangerous dog first time this happens to us and def not denying that we are in the wrong here just need to understand the consequences we would be facing so we can prepare for it thank you edit we are in texas,"Your wife was walking your dog near your home when it ran up and nipped a delivery driver who was walking by. The bite was deep enough to break the skin, although there was no bleeding. The driver asked if the dog was vaccinated, which your wife confirmed, and then left. You are wondering if you are liable for any medical bills and if this will affect your dog's status. 

Texas does have laws that can hold dog owners liable for injuries their pets cause, even if the owner had no prior knowledge of the dog's aggressive behavior. That being said, liability for injuries a dog causes depends on the circumstances of the bite and the state's specific dog bite laws. 

It would be best to consult with a legal professional specializing in animal law or a veterinarian familiar with Texas' dog bite laws to better understand your liability in this situation. They can provide accurate and up-to-date information regarding your legal obligations and how Texas' dog bite laws apply to your case. 

In the meantime, you should avoid leaving your dog off-leash in public, as this is a violation of most municipalities' leash laws and increases the risk of incidents like this."
work for relatively large corporation as technician before got hired it was explained to me that our productivity would be tracked measured and used to dictate our pay the main focus of these metrics is the number of units or jobs completed before went to training was told by the shop lead and manager that the trainers do not know what they re doing was also told we will fail as technicians if we listen to the trainers while in training it became apparent that the majority of the company does not follow the prescribed installation procedure during training the company organized competition for the best installers in the company while competing the best installers are given ideal conditions and it still takes them an hour to complete an installation while following procedure however every shop in the area has at least one technician doing unit hour during my training it was also encouraged that we clock out if there no work to be done it was pointed out the software can see and records when you re not clocked into job essentially if they did not make enough sales your metrics and pay go down or you can clock out asked if they would record and give payment to technicians who made sales they said that was ridiculous have also been encouraged to not take my state mandated breaks get regularly harassed by the shop lead and manager because they want to count every break as lunch but the law requires an unpaid lunch with minute breaks after awhile also noticed that some schedules are more efficient than others needing to pick up parts having lot of drive time or being given more difficult jobs take more time than the alternatives there are also issues with customers that the technician cannot control or dictate did the customer not answer their phone call voicemail text message and was not at the given address well too bad drive back there and finish the job it was also around this time that noticed the units completed did not line up with how many jobs were on my schedule new technician is given jobs to complete day technician will complete units day senior techs complete units day and master techs complete units day started with jobs and my completed units were around day eventually started to have units on my schedule now this schedule is not entirely unreasonable for someone who is being paid at master tech level given reasonable route and the ability to have some discretion decision making ability at some point brought this up to the manager he did not really address the part about most employees not following procedure or my units not adding up but he did tell me we can record the time we wasted and that should not be counted against us ok so start recording and reporting my additional or wasted time spent on jobs but my units completed were still about half of what it should have been after few weeks of no change and my numbers still not reflecting the work am completing send text message to my district manager and direct manager let them know that would like to have schedule that is reasonable for technician because would like to improve my customer service and quality also let them know that would continue to do more work from units up to units if my pay increased they informed me that was recorded only completing around units day how could that be when there are on my schedule so started saving my route sheets and writing notes on them would then compare that to all the invoiced jobs to see if could figure out why my jobs do not add up had week where was missing units and could see job on my route sheet but it was not invoiced when we looked into why it was not invoiced the system we use went down and failed to collect payment called the store to say could not process payment but no one answered but did text the manager that there was an issue with the card processing and went to the next customer still do not know if that job has been recorded or counted towards my completed units or not but assume it has not after this point sent an email to hr and let them know what going on outlined the above as well as some additional grievances software crashing and other process stuff this email received no reply during this was longer able to receive the invoiced printouts and started taking photos of old parts from the completed jobs about two weeks later get called into managers office he asked me what time clocked out and went home the day before told him there was no work to get done and our manager usually sends us home if that the case so took lunch and clocked out around the manager then asks me why was at home instead of working and on the clock at was pretty confused about this as know what time left the job and clocked out because texted my girlfriend done with work and getting groceries the manager then tells me the tracker on the work van says was home at but still clocked in he also asked why only completed one job from the day before explained to him that pretty sure that not possible because finished lunch the customers job took lunch and texted my girlfriend at that going to clock out and get groceries but he was not having it so go back to my work van and look through my phone to see the text message sent the customer telling them was completed with the job exactly minutes or lunch period before would have done my last clock out also had the idea to check the work phone for pictures of the job sure enough there are phones from the job time stamped with the customer the work van in the background and geo tagged at the job address also have picture of the old parts from that job have emailed hr one final time and have gotten zero action simply phone call saying they will look into things my question is what claims can legally make and what evidence can gather to make this case stronger,"You have several potential claims, including failure to pay wages and overtime, violation of break and lunch periods, and wrongful termination. To strengthen your case, you should gather evidence such as time sheets, route sheets, pictures of completed jobs, and texts or emails showing discrepancies between your work hours and jobs completed. It's also critical to document any instances of harassment or discrimination and keep a record of communications with HR and management. 

Were you able to resolve this issue with your employer? If not, you may wish to contact an attorney to discuss your legal options."

The friend does not have a license or permit and refuses to pay for the damage. You are considering suing them and want to understand the risks involved. 
This scenario presents a few legal questions:

- Can someone who does not have a license or permit legally drive a vehicle in Kansas? - Who is responsible for damages caused by the friend driving your car? - What legal options do you have to recover damages, and what risks do you face if you pursue a lawsuit? 
These questions often depend on the specific circumstances and local laws, and to get detailed accurate answers, it would be best to consult with a traffic lawyer or insurance agent familiar with Kansas state laws. They can advise you on the legal implications of this situation, possible liability, and the best course of action to recover damages. 

It is essential to understand that consulting with a legal professional does not automatically initiate legal proceedings but provides you with guidance and knowledge to help you decide your next steps."

His grandfather, who is his legal guardian, has recently stopped sending him to visit you and is now refusing to return him to your care. You're concerned he will try to adopt your nephew, cutting you out of his life. You've filed for emergency guardianship which will be heard in a few days. 

It would be difficult to provide any confident assessment of your chances of successfully gaining emergency guardianship without knowing more about the specific laws and procedures in your state. 

It will be important to demonstrate to the court that you and your husband have been acting as de facto parents to your nephew for a significant period of time and that your nephew is thriving in your care. It will also be important to address the concerns of the guardian, such as your son's relationship with his grandparents and the possibility of continued contact. 

You should also be prepared to provide assurances that you are capable of managing any medical or psychological concerns, such as your son's bipolar disorder and suicidality risks, and that you have a supportive network of family and/or friends who can assist you."

They were able to get the title transferred for the other vehicle, which only had the deceased person's name on it."

was having conversation with some friends obviously apocalypse movies and tv shows came up after we memed on lou do not care about the controversy over joel etc but we were discussing how abby and joel but should not exist in an apocalypse scenario where would you get the proteins and workout stuff to get that fit where do you get your protein shakes in an apocalypse scenario most groceries and modern diet staples would not be thing imo movie wise feel like resident evil movies are bad at it look at mila she has this pristine makeup face where do you fine time to apply eyeliner or where do you find eyeliner and the food to keep up that physique,"In apocalyptic movies and TV shows, characters like Abby and Joel from The Last of Us frequently have exceptional physiques that would require a substantial amount of protein and other nutrients to maintain. However, in a post-apocalyptic world, many grocery stores and modern dietary staples would likely not be accessible. This presents a challenge for survivalist fiction to realistically depict characters' fitness and nutrition. Additionally, characters in these movies are often shown with elaborate makeup and clothing, which would be difficult to find the time and resources to maintain in a chaotic and resource-scarce environment. Resident Evil is criticized for this because of Mila's well-maintained appearance."
think we re supposed to be the ancient gods in cabin in the woods because the film is sort of ironic and plays on the stereotype and back in the day the sacrifices were simple and guess that just how our stories used to be that entertained us but now for us to rave about movie it gotta be complex and have nuance etc etc but if the ancient gods aren happy the end the world which if we the viewers aren happy we end the world of that movie because studios won make another because we don like it and because cabin in the woods is directly targeting slasher films and mentions the failure and believe that related to film named the faculty where none of the main cast dies therefore failure and therefore the world ended no sequel but the worlds that follow the rules scream friday the th halloween etc they carry on indefinitely,"You may have noticed that the Cabin in the Woods, despite having an upbeat ending, never sets up for a sequel, and there haven't been any announcements for one. This is because the plot is a meta-commentary on the horror genre: the gods represent the viewers, and the sacrifice of Dana and Marty represents the studios' willingness to kill off beloved characters to raise the stakes and surprise the audience. TheFaculty, another meta-horror movie, ended without a sequel, similar to Cabin in the Woods."
do not mean it bad film but it kinda funny how the film is about treating them as mythic heroes with legendary adventures when the original movie is comedy about four shlubby nobodies essentially running get rich quick scheme who accidentally become heroes from pure coincidence get why because hollywood is obsessed with nostalgia so the people seeing it were probably kids who saw them as heroes unaware that it raunchy comedy more like animal house than star wars also it was directed by the original director son jason reitman so there that,"It's amusing how the new film treats the characters from the original movie, which was a raunchy comedy about a failed get-rich-quick scheme, as mythic heroes in a story about adolescence when the original was just a coincidence. This is likely due to Hollywood's obsession with nostalgia, and it was also directed by the son of the original director."
in most good vs evil or good vs bad the good guys win save the day defeat the villains or monster and everyone can sleep happily ever after what are some movies where the monster evil or villain wins the endings are often unsettling for the viewer few can think of life darkness the thing maybe unknown not referring to cliffhangers that could possibly or do lead to sequels,"It can be unsettling for viewers when the villain or monster triumphs over the hero in a good-versus-evil story. This can be seen in movies where the antagonist's actions have disastrous consequences for the protagonist and others, and where the ending leaves viewers with a sense of darkness and uncertainty. Some examples of such movies are ""The Thing"" and ""Unknown."" 

Would you like me to help you generate ideas for a film where the villain triumphs, or suggest other films with similar themes to those you've mentioned?"
felt like just yesterday when he came out storming the mid cinema with spate of fan favorites interview with the vampire legend of the fall monkeys and of course seven the rest as they say is history as look back at his career the films that myself have watched probably not even third of them although did catch the famous ones there something impalpable about him as an actor is he one of the all time greats imo no his performance is often one note relying on his presence rather than craft to impress yet he had many memorable roles and in some of them ad astra in recent years for instance he showcased depth and nuance that makes you wonder what else could he have achieved for some professions is considered the beginning of the end hope that not the case for pitt cannot wait to see more of him and that guess is the greatest compliment you can pay to an artist,"While Brad Pitt's acting is often criticized as one-note, there is no denying his cultural significance and talent. With memorable roles in Interview with the Vampire, Legends of the Fall, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Pitt's career has been full of highlights. His recent role in Ad Astra showed a depth and nuance that showcases his potential for even greater performances. 
Pitt is widely considered one of the greatest actors of his generation, and fans can't wait to see what he does next."

Bad animated family films are also common, potentially worse as they're marketed to a wider audience, and can result in more poorly received films like Norm of the North, The Emoji Movie, or Marmaduke."
feminist theory in psychology is actually about the position of all people as they struggle against systematic disparity most people do not know that woman or not it about empowerment and reflection this movie freaking nails it amidst the over the top visuals and gags lies satire and under the satire lies an incredibly well put message of individual revolution against cultural expectations and our programming it does so damn much with well done parts that sad for those who do not get it or missed the point because it so feminist in nature plus the fact that it also totally and visually appealing to young people impresses ne so very much say this as year old dude with two young daughters it made me think bit therapist man father white dude and person who been through some stuff and it spoke to me on every level well done film well done tl dr amateur wannabe film guy here watch barbie,"Despite its appearance, the movie Barbie is well done in terms of conveying feminist theory in psychology, which is about empowering individuals to fight against systemic discrimination. This movie speaks to me on many levels as a therapist and father of two girls. Barbie does a great job of conveying a strong feminist message through vivid visuals and satire, targeting cultural expectations and how individuals are programmed. Unfortunately, many people miss the point of the movie due to its strong feminist theme."

some of the rest of my analysis continues in the comment section since it seems to limit typing longer essay explaining what want to express corpse bride is among my favorite animated films of all time and one of the most significant animated works of my childhood remember watching it multiple times and it no wonder the animation and character designs are incredibly gorgeous the musical scenes are fantastic as someone who is not fan of them and it also incredibly dark as story with its mention of murder depictions of corpses and characters dying recently due to self inflicted harm think everything about it is great but as of recently think the character that makes this movie even more special is our female lead emily the corpse bride first of all really love her design love the contrasts of her design looking both beautiful in the pure sense while also containing the gothic nature of the state of being dead its also just pretty detailed and pretty to look and it contrast from her otherwise lively and joyful personality that we see in the movie although also think there also something very meaningful about her story and character arc which ll explain why in lot of stories especially movies like disney animated films we often have the female character whose main goal is to find the person that they love and in the end they do find that the love of their life and get their happy ending to be in love or to be married is presented as the source of happiness and fulfillment and do not think that necessarily wrong at all if you find joy in being with the person you love think that beautiful thing and think that as long as both of you are willing to stay together and are happy think that in it of itself is something fulfilling everyone will have their own kind of happiness and fulfillment from getting married to doing great painting or just helping and being nice to others each of them is valid and it does not need to be the most important and most impactful to the world to be meaningful and valuable it depends on how it makes you and that what matters as long as it does not hurt others however what if what we think will make us happy does not and will not make us happy what if that happiness gets in the way of somebody else happiness and from making someone else happy does what society tell you will make you happy means that all there is for you what do you for yourself and those you love these questions are explored with emily we first meet emily in the forest when victor is practicing to propose to victoria due to his deep insecurity and forgetfulness tha prevents him from doing it correctly after trying few times he is finally able to do it well and puts the ring on root that looks strangely like human hand and then it turns out that it is indeed hand belonging to murdered bride named emily who wakes up to his practice proposal and because of this emily mistakenly believes that victor and her are meant to be together forever however victor is understandably terrified and conflicted due to the fact that emily is the corpse of woman he does not know and has his eyes on victoria and throughout the movie we see her trying to spend time with victor and hoping that they marry as he tries to come back to the living world with his future living wife we learn from the dead people in the underworld the story of the bride it is revealed that she has been murdered by her partner years ago one night trying to run away with him with the plan of marrying him it implied that whoever this man was he did not care to be with emily and only got to close to her to satisfy his greed from this story we are meant to realize something aout what going on with our female lead emily is in sort of psychological purgatory in which she needs to complete her journey of finding the love of their life in order to ascend to her happiness emily seems to not just be dead in the literal sense but in way she is metaphorically in temporary death one of lack of fulfillment because she has not yet got to do what she felt she needed to do with her murderer who she was meant to love to emily victor would be her escape from her purgatory and reach her own personal heaven throughout the film we see her trying to get victor to be with her by reaching him and reuniting with his undead dog believing wholeheartedly that they re supposed to be in love however she becomes more and more upset and conflicted with his rejections and when he tricks her into coming back to his world and seeing victoria which she is hurt by when she finds out wondering why is it that in her eyes he proposed to her and yet does not want to be with her this causes her to question her self worth as lover but also grow sad and angry at victor for not making her believe that they do indeed need to be together because that the faith that was meant for her and him to be happily ever after both in life and death however after victor reconciles with emily and finds out that victoria has upcoming marriage with another man named barkins that was forced on her by her rich parents victor now decides that he does want to marry emily even as he is told that he needs to drink poison in the living world that will kill him so he unites with emily he is still willing to do so and at first they both seem to be happy to do this the living dead prepare for the ceremony and they all go to the living world and reunite with their living family members then we see victoria come to reject barkins when she hears of his intentions to only marry her for money and goes through straight to the ceremony to witness them marry however as emily sees victoria she come to realization she is not meant to be with victor not only would marrying victor be something that ultimately would not be the best for victor and take away another woman chance to be with the person they want to marry but it would not make her very happy that in way she is forcing someone to try to make her happy in the sacrifice of finding their own for her sake just like her before victoria would become the same as her lost and without love and as result she accepts not to marry victor and reunites victor and victoria this reunion however would be interrupted by barkins who attempts to kidnap victoria this triggers her memory and barkins of who each other are barkins turns out to actually be her ex fianc who has murdered her years ago revealing that he was planning to do to victoria the same tha he has done with emily this results in the most badass duel between victor and barkins in which victor fights barkins with goddamn fork the fight goes on until barkins catches him in moment where he is about stab victor only to reveal that he has stabbed unaffected emily who saves his life and wields his sword against him continue with part in oldest comment,"The movie Corpse Bride explores the concept of happiness and fulfillment through marriage contrasted with a forced arrangement for personal gain. The character of Emily, a corpse bride, undergoes a journey to find true love and achieve happiness. Her arc serves as a metaphor for the pursuit of fulfillment and the consequences of forcing happiness on others. By uniting Victor and Victoria, Emily ensures that both of them can find their own happiness rather than sacrificing her own for Victor."

love her ve been reading her reviews and boy is she tough she was not afraid to speak her mind she was also brilliant writer much better than the pulitzer prize winning roger ebert whom feel was too generous as critic garfield stars this is not to say pauline got everything right she was often accused of being homophobic though she was surrounded by gay men but pauline was witty and very consistent she raved about bonnie and clyde and last tango in paris she got in trouble for the latter she got fired for panning the sound of music her books on movies were widely read and are must reads for every true cinephile miss critics like her today too many critics are internet influencers who are dumb as it and are total geeks we went from bosley crowther andrew sarris kael and judith crist to john campea and grace randolph sad,"The critic Pauline Kael is admired for her fearless and witty reviews. Although she was often accused of being homophobic, she was a brilliant writer who raved about several landmark films, only to get in trouble for panning others, most notably ""The Sound of Music."" Today, many people long for the kind of rigorous film criticism that Kael practiced."
disney the wild from is incredibly overhated sure it might be kinda rip off of madagascar but mean come on this movie is childhood hidden gem it has amazing animation and an incredible cast kiefer sutherland jim belushi greg cipes william shatner and patrick warburton not to mention some great early songs only thing think this movie got wrong was ryan age look in the movie samson says he and ryan doesn have mane but lions get their mane when they turn so ryan should ve had mane as big as samson that the only problem if you ask me youtube recently put this in the movies area for free with ad and it was great to go back and revisit my childhood what do you think of it,"Disney movie ""The Wild"" from 2006 is a childhood gem for the speaker, who thinks that it is an underappreciated movie despite being a ripoff of ""Madagascar"". It has an excellent cast and animation, with the only flaw being that the main character Ryan should have had a mane, like real lions do."
with lynch taking ages between films only jordan peele and charlie kaufman seem to be aiming for risky career in more or less experimental filmmaking when it comes to shows things do get more interesting with stuff like nathan fielder the rehearsal or atlanta but when it comes to cinema there seems to be little to no daring innovation am not looking in the right places or is it really like that understand at least as an aspiring screenwriter that producers won take risk that wont produce returns to high degree of certainty robert mckee said as much in story paraphrasing would you put your money on project when as of now nobody seems to be watching that experimental stuff but at the same time more films are being made today than at any point in time in history not suggesting we should get films with no plot or films that are experimental for its own sake but at time when loads of films come out every week it is odd that there are so few being john malkovich or phantom of liberty being made today everything is new in technological way especially involving visuals but there little to no experimentation with structure and story there also seems to be no place for movements within cinema nothing like goddard french new wage or bu uel surrealism it does not feel like these or other movements could even take place now but that another issue the thing is that we aren getting any films that seem to throw caution to the wind and take risks like my dinner with andre just taking place over conversation beau is afraid and nope are the only examples can think of in recent years but they seem tame in comparison to how arresting gaspar noe irreversible is in the way it is told am not referring to the content but the form and at the same time this one seems leagues away from say dogville list of experimental films like this one only seems to point out to films years or older even though now we are making more than ever independent cinema having being the cradle of this sort of innovation seems to have abandoned it completely kind of hope am wrong and you guys point me towards loads of different stuff being done today because love to watch stuff that finds new ways to tell story and dares to do what needs to do but it seems can find that going back decades,"It seems that there is a lack of innovation in terms of storytelling in contemporary cinema. Recent films seem to follow tried and tested formulas and structures, with fewer experiments with narrative form. Although there are more films being made now than ever before, it appears that there is little room for risky or experimental filmmaking. However, there are still some examples of innovative films, such as those by directors like Jordan Peele and Charlie Kaufman. The independent cinema scene, which has traditionally been a haven for experimental filmmaking, seems to have lost its edge in this regard. 
The narrator is wondering if they are just not looking in the right places for innovative modern films or if there is a genuine lack of creative risk-taking in contemporary cinema."
heists spycraft long cons love all of it but trying to find more is surprisingly difficult searching for recommendations mostly just end up on lists along the lines of bond and bourne movies that are action thrillers first and foremost where the intrigue and social manipulation only serve as backdrop what are the best movies where plots and duplicity are the main focus things along the lines of the ocean trilogy the tv series hustle or books like dark alliance or abnett legion,"You love movies and TV shows that are centered around heists, spycraft, and long cons, but you're struggling to find good recommendations. You're looking for plots that are similar to the Ocean's trilogy or the TV series Hustle, where deception and cunning are at the forefront, rather than action thrillers like James Bond or Jason Bourne movies where intrigue and social manipulation take a backseat to high-octane action. 

Would you like suggestions for movies or TV shows that fit this description? Alternatively, I could recommend similar books to Dark Alliance or Abnett Legion if you'd like to explore the genre further. 

Let me know if you have a specific genre or medium you'd like to focus on, and I'll be happy to provide some tailored recommendations."
in my mid twenties so it safe to say that wasn paying too much attention to movie releases in mean that the same year transformers came out and then ironman the following year so that all could remember being excited about it wasn until recent episode of vfx artists reacts on corridor crew that they reviewed scene from sunshine and recommended it as great watch me and the wife didn have anything in particular we wanted to watch tonight so we pulled up our recommendations list and was like let try this out so we totally went in blind only knowing it had something to do with trip to the sun and uh holy shit this movie was just an incredible experience start to finish heard people didn like the rd act as much and while think they have valid criticisms loved the movie all the way through the cast is insane now the plot is simple one but the themes questions and answers are fascinating loved the how the sun was treated in this movie as some god like entity that drove crew members mad such cool concept anyway looking for more movies that might ve missed like this early maybe even and movies so far similar movies put down on my list to this are event horizon and pandorum although it be worth noting that me and the wife aren huge horror fans sunshine was definitely creepy and scary sometimes but we could handle it lol barely anyone have any recommendations,"You should watch Sunshine if you haven't! It's comparable to movies like Event Horizon and Pandorum, but it's not a horror movie. The plot is simple, but the themes are fascinating, and the visual effects are stunning. Sunshine tells a story about a crew on a mission to rekindle the dying sun, but the journey drives them mad."
fair warning below contain spoilers for james bond daniel craig movies the watchmen comic and batman court of owls comic this week my wife and watched all the daniel craig bond movies for the first time it took about seven days total as some days we split the movie in parts it pretty fun ride especially as someone who hasn seen any bond movie before we watched no time to die today what was rami malek motivation know rami malek was planning on releases bio engineered virus of nano bots that would murder millions but why paid attention to the film and just couldn figure out his motivation at one point spectre reminded me little bit of watchmen in the fact of ozymandius they committed atrocities in order to set up defense network of connected intelligence agencies to protect everyone much like how ozymandius orchestrated atrocities to set up defense alliance between usa and soviets spectre also gave me mad court of owls vibes it was also interesting seeing ana de armas play nervous very green field agent couldn tell at one point if it was bad acting or if she just was in character and that how the character was supposed to act lol either way she is delightful,"My wife and I watched all Daniel Craig's Bond movies for the first time, finishing with No Time to Die. I noticed similarities between Spectre and the Watchmen and Batman: Court of Owls comics, such as committing atrocities to safeguard people through defense networks. Rami Malek's motivation in No Time to Die was to release a bioengineered virus of nano bots to kill millions. Ana de Armas played a very green field agent role, which was interesting to watch."
often overlooked feel maybe not but for me hunchback of notre dame does not get enough credit for how deep and hard it goes in terms of story telling and depiction of that era culture it goes from loveable carefree respectful helping lifestyles to total imperialistic control that dominated the background and even within that empire style system you see the priest cracking and being tormented because deep down he longs for that king of life love but is so dedicated to his faith that he has to fight it to remain and retain his position could go on but recently rewatched this movie and it tremendously sad in my opinion depicts the atrocities that occured during the time but also the love joy and torment on all sides curious on your thoughts let discuss,"The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a movie that tells a deep story and includes depictions of empire culture of that era. It goes from a lovable lifestyle to one of imperialistic control, and the priest's struggle between longing for a carefree life and retaining his faith. It depicts the atrocities of the time, but also shows the love, joy, and torment on all sides."
recently on askreddit mentioned that this film has been living rent free in my mind since september or october and frankly was very disturbed by the film the setting watched the film in and just have had nothing but unwelcome thoughts in my mind because of that film has anyone else had this problem with the film or am just little disturbed,"The movie has been stuck in their mind since September or October and they can't stop thinking about it. They are disturbed by the film and the setting in which they watched it, and it has caused them to have unpleasant thoughts. They are wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience."
wanted to watch the barbie movie with my mom today and wanted to give her the full theater experience but at home since it came out on hbo max today however could not find the compilation of commercials they showed before the actual movie was my theater the only one to do this it was hard finding any evidence that it happened elsewhere no posts or even mentions of it does anyone have link to it or even recall it for that matter,You could not find the compilation of commercials that traditionally play before the Barbie movie started when you tried to watch it on HBO Max at home. You are wondering if anyone has a link to it or can recall this experience.
know this is dumb question the downvotes on another movie sub informed me how dumb this is but sincerely asking one more try must have missed some exposition or something somewhere james stewart follows novak to her apartment mckittrick apartments she seen in the window from the street he goes in and talks to the establishment owner who says she has not seen carlotta come in and in fact the key to the room is still hanging there so confused by this understand the implications we re watching ghost story of sorts at this point but how does she pull that off and to what end this is not the empire hotel where we later find novak actually residing,"In 'Rope', James Stewart follows Novak to what he thinks is her apartment, only to find that Carlotta hasn't been there and the key to her room is still there, suggesting that Novak has pulled off quite the deception regarding her actual residence."

just finished watching carnage for the second time in two weeks and this movie is amazing numerous cannot catch your breath moments witty relationship gender commentary good political commentary everything about this movie was absolutely perfect not to mention an absolute banger of cast with jodie foster christoph waltz kate winslet and john reilly all perfectly cast in their respective roles pola ski is horrible person and had trouble getting into more modern movie directed by him at first hence the second watch but this movie ultimately won me over against my own will it understandable that any movie directed by him will be to some degree outcast nowadays by the media and critics but thought this movie is too good to ignore perfect entry in the black comedy genre,"The movie Carnage is an outstanding black comedy with an incredible cast, witty dialogue and unexpected moments. The media and critics might underrate it because it is directed by Polański, however, the movie deserves more attention."
is it just me or is this dude chronic overactor it like before every take he in the dressing room snorting blow or speed or something just constant teeth gritted red eyed sweaty tension and no other emotional tone ve seen him in plenty of stuff and just can get into the dude not saying he bad actor per se just that he has one speed and it gets to be kind of ridiculous,"You think this actor seems over-dramatic in the way he acts in the dressing room before every take, snorting drugs, gritting his teeth, with red eyes and sweaty tension. You have seen him in other things but don't think he portrays other emotional tones apart from this tense manner.  You are not saying he is a bad actor, but you think he needs to diversify his acting skills."
this could be things like sloppy twist poorly executed genre shift new character out of nowhere abrupt pacing changes towards the end an unearned deus ex machina or many other things for me the most memorable example is now you see me it was fun romp until the end when it goes full melodrama reveals,"Certain narrative techniques can ruin the effect of a story, such as sloppy plot twists, poorly executed genre changes, new characters introduced abruptly, uneven pacing, and deus ex machina. An example is the film Now You See Me, which was enjoyable until its melodramatic ending that introduced unresolved plot threads."
am going to prove everything this kid says is wrong actually it baldwin class berkshire type steam locomotive built in at the baldwin locomotive works it weighs pounds and has tractive force of pounds its top speed is false although the locomotive is based on the pere marquette the know it all kids description of it matched that of the erie railroad no another berkshire that looked very similar in appearence source you know montezuma the king of the aztecs would drink quarts of hot chocolate every day false from time to time they served him montezuma in cups of pure gold certain drink made from cacao it was said that it gave one power over women but this never saw did see them bring in more than fifty large pitchers of cacao with froth in it and he drank some of it the women serving with great reverence source yeah it violation of railroad safety regulations for kid to cross moving cars without grown up false there is no such regulation and nothing of the sort is mentioned in title subtitle chapter ii of the code of federal regulations source you know what goanna happen now do not ya he goanna throw her off the train yeah he probably goanna throw her right off the rear platform it standard procedure that way she will not get sucked down under the wheels they may slow the train down little bit but they re never goanna stop it do not really feel the need to specifically disprove this one as its just so ludicrous and obviously does not happen even in the movie hey you missed it we rode down some really sharp hills and then we were on what looked like frozen lake but know it was just an optical illusion caused by moonlight atmosphere are you kidding me,"The text is about a conversation between a know-it-all kid and an adult in which the kid makes various claims, many of which are disproved by the adult. The kid claims that a locomotive they saw is of a specific type and weighs a certain amount, which is false according to the adult's knowledge. The kid also claims that Montezuma, the Aztec king, drank large quantities of chocolate, but the adult argues that while chocolate was served to Montezuma, it was done in moderation. The kid further claims that it is illegal for them to walk across moving train cars, which the adult proves false by citing railroad safety regulations. The kid also shares an exaggerated story about their train ride and alleges that it was riding down sharp hills and crossing what looked like a frozen lake, which the adult calls an illusion caused by the moonlight."
someone correct me if wrong but feel like the lost world premise was pretty popular years ago and while don think it that unpopular feel like in recent times see less and less lost world journey esc movies and books probably doing poor job explaining but movies think of as examples are the dinosaur project journey to the center of the earth the original and remake journey sir arthur conan doyle the lost world the lost world jurassic park kong movies like peter jackson skull island honestly would even include the hunter though it not as close to these feel like recently though kong skull island is the most recent or maybe though it not complete fit for this category there been steady decline of movies like this think meg and jumanji could fit into this category but overall the genre has faded is it cause the age of exploration is less of thing general population interest have shifted anyone else have any thoughts on this or think completely wrong or if you also love movies or books like this leave them below would love to watch more,"You are correct in that the ""lost world"" genre, featuring plots centring on exotic, often dinosaur-filled locales remote from civilization, was once quite popular in movies and literature. Indeed, the Jurassic Park franchise could be said to have begun with the novel Journey to the Center of the Earth. By your account, however, it seems that in recent years, such stories have lost their appeal. There are various possible reasons for this, including the decline of genuine interest in actual exploration, changes in cultural tastes, and perhaps that these plots are simply overly familiar to modern audiences. 

Certainly, other viewers who share your interest in this genre would be welcome to share their thoughts on why this genre has waned in popularity or to suggest movies or books that would fit this category."
have seen disturbing stuff in real life survived war not so long ago when was young so the movies people usually recommend just are not enough to scare or disturb me have watched martyrs and enjoyed it but it did not do the trick for me even the ending scene was like meh also do not want some cheap film that is very disgusting for the sake of being disgusting midsommar was very enjoyable and made me wanna get terrified of movie do you guys have any recommendations,"You seek more disturbing and scary movies than those you have seen before, because you have experienced the horrors of war firsthand. You find that many violent and gory films are not disgusting or scary enough, or at least not in a way that resonates with you. You have already watched Martyrs and Midsommar, and you are looking for other movies that can terrify you."
my wife favorite comedy film trope is when character very briefly turns into skeleton this happens in films such as home alone and planes trains and automobiles she loses it every time and thinks it is the funniest thing in the world random know am trying to come up with other films where this very niche trope takes place google was of no help so turn to the citizens of reddit whatcha got,"My wife loves the comedy trope where a character turns into a skeleton briefly. Examples of this include Home Alone and Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Can you suggest other films that feature this niche trope? It would be a great help!

after listening to the zodiac dvd commentary it became clear that david fincher conducted very thorough investigation of the the case meeting with many of the real people involved in the investigation wanted to ask if anyone knew of any resources where he elaborates further on his investigation or the production in general,"You're asking for any resources (like interviews, articles) where David Fincher talks about his investigation into the Zodiac killer for the movie he directed, or about the production of the movie in general. 

Did you know that David Fincher is also known for his rigorous approach to researching and preparing for his movies? He has spoken about his dedication to accuracy and detail in many of his films, and how he uses these techniques to craft compelling stories."
was talking about this with my friend for me it parasite since then cannot really think of anything the last really good hollywood movie to be released have no idea probably whiplash tbh but yeah any studio produced film or independent does not matter that you think was really well made,"You mentioned that since watching the movie Parasite you can't think of any other good films, potentially suggesting that Parasite was an exceptional film for you. You mentioned Whiplash as another film that you perhaps enjoyed a lot, but you can't think of any other films that stood out to you. 

Did you intend to search for other films similar to Parasite or Whiplash that you might enjoy?"
have always loved the muppet christmas carol to this day it is still my favorite version of the dickens classic the muppets are always amazing and funny in all the right ways but for me having narrator adds so much to the story while it isn my favorite not sure there is better film adaption of the story than the tv movie starring george scott amazing acting from every actor great pacing and the right level of creepy,"The Muppet Christmas Carol is one of the best film adaptations of Dickens' classic story. The muppets are hilarious as always, and the narrator adds a lot to the story. George Scott also does an amazing job, as do all the actors in this TV movie. It has great pacing and just the right amount of creepiness."

whenever see people talk about the saw movies nobody ever mentions the prequels which is more of crime than any of the stuff jigsaw has done his origin story is so fun to see watching how maniacal he becomes towards the end as he tries to kill the burglars making traps for them to fall into as they enter child jigsaw home they play it as comedy but man knowing what he becomes makes it so much creepier seeing his family was an interesting aspect too showing how he always been wronged by the world even as child his own family treating him so poorly then theres sequel where he branches out to new york and tries to get revenge on the burglars who escape his wrath in the first film we even see child jigsaw meet future president know they tried to make more of the prequels showing different kids but let be honest only the first are worth watching what do you guys think,"The Saw prequels show the origin of the famous villain Jigsaw and his descent into darkness. While the movies are comedic, the knowledge of Jigsaw's later actions makes his behavior far more sinister. The sequels expand his story as he tries to get revenge on people from his past. Overall, the prequels provide a interesting look into the background of the famous killer."
do not even remember how many movies saw where if man an woman fall together on the ground in scene for some reason the girl will always land on the guy laps crouch in suggestive position this always looks silly and even sometimes weird what other hollywood cliche are still being used and are annoying to the max,"When a man and woman fall onto the ground in a movie for any reason, the woman often lands in a suggestive position on the man's lap; this is annoying and unrealistic to some viewers. There are other Hollywood cliches that also irritate audiences, such as when a character is knocked unconscious and falls dramatically off their feet. Another example is when an actor is portraying an intense scene and someone off-screen screams their name to get their attention, causing them to abruptly turn with an angry look."
movies that do not use darkness to create fear was thinking that do not know any horror or thriller movies that are scary without majority of scenes happening in the dark maybe it just me but if the area is well lit it just does not seem scary any movies that are able to create fear even in bright or unusual places very sick of movies where the protagonist goes into dark basement or forest at night and makes it obvious they re about to die bonus if the jump scare is lead up to by crescendo with pause in the soundtrack are my hopes too high,"I'm looking for non-horror movies that create a fearful atmosphere, preferably in well-lit or unusual locations and without relying on jump scares aided by a pause in the soundtrack. Do such films exist?"
trying to watch more movie of the master the only movies ve seen are yojimbo and seven samurai and plan on watching rashomon next not sure how consistent kurosawa was with his success rate because only know the mentioned were all of his movies good or did he have bad ones too what are some of his must watch films would appreciate your recommendations,"You should watch Rashomon (1950) next, as it is another masterpiece by Kurosawa and one of the most influential films in the history of cinema. Despite having a high success rate, Kurosawa did direct some films that are not as highly regarded. 

Some other must-watch films by Kurosawa include:

1. Ikiru (1952): About a man struggling with mortality and the meaning of life. 
2. High and Low (1963): A powerful drama that explores social differences and the impact of a kidnapping. 
3. Throne of Blood (1957): A reimagining of Shakespeare's Macbeth set in feudal Japan. 
4. The Hidden Fortress (1958): A classic samurai adventure featuring memorable characters and clever storytelling. 
5. Ran (1985): A dramatic tale of betrayal and war, inspired by King Lear. 

Remember, while these films are highly regarded for their directorial vision, storyline, and technical achievements, personal preferences may vary."
christmas movies often show parents not believing in santa at first but then something magical happens to make them believe the problem is if they do not believe in santa how do they explain the gifts that magically show up it like saying santa is not real but then not questioning where the gifts came from,"Parents in Christmas movies often start off not believing in Santa, but something magical happens to make them believe. However, this can create a logical conundrum for them: if they don't believe in Santa, how do they explain the appearance of gifts that magically show up? This is like saying Santa isn't real but not questioning where the gifts come from."
it clear though that back then nobody really cared about spoilers as much for whatever reason movie trailers basically summarized the whole movie in minutes novelizations for blockbusters would hit stores month or more before the movie came out critics like siskel and ebert would show off plenty of spoilerific clips with permission from the studio including clips from the ending on the youtube comments for the two towers trailer you can see lot of comments from likely younger people amazed that they gave away that gandalf returns or that the trailer gave away arnold being the good guy this time even though to the studio that would seem like the obvious selling point of the movie,"People didn't care about spoilers in movie trailers and other promotional materials in the past. For instance, trailers for the movie 'The Two Towers' would openly show the biggest twists from the movie, including a clip showcasing Gandalf's return and Arnold as the good guy. People would comment on these spoilers without care, amazed at the reveals."
so like most people scrolling through netflix in saw her and thought it was timely movie to watch it is but there is this scene which keeps haunting my thoughts and wondering if anyone else things about it like do in one of the main character theos flashbacks to his wife there is scene where she is on top of his with her hands around his throat he laughing as she straight face tells him to stop laughing going to fucking kill you fucking love you and going to kill you and other things like that couldn find the scene clip but you get the idea honestly that is the most disturbing part of the movie to me because it is so out of character and line for the movie what do you all think the significance of this scene was in context with the movie still thinking so much about it like why was this scene in there,"You are disturbed by a scene in the Netflix movie, 'See Her', where a wife threatens to kill her husband with laughter, which you find out of place and disturbing. You are wondering about the significance of this scene and why it was included in the movie."

You've watched a lot of horror movies and you'd like help finding something new and more terrifying, unlike The Crow which was more action-oriented."
ive been wondering this for while when its comes to the original wonka movie especially since first heard of the new wonka movie whenever hear people talk about the original it all about how much they love gene wilders portrayal never hear anyone praise anything else about the movie so just makes me wonder if they only like it because of him there is lot more to the movie than just one actor after all now look unpopular opinion not big fan of that version but lots of people are and like to learn different perspectives what is your favorite thing about that movie beyond just the wonka actor that makes you love the original,"People frequently discuss the actor Gene Wilder when praising the 1971 Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory film, but there must be other aspects that people enjoy about the film. What do you like about the movie besides Gene Wilder's portrayal of Wonka? 

It would be helpful if you could provide examples of your favorite scenes or elements from the movie that you enjoy besides the performance of Gene Wilder as Wonka.

just the weirder oddball choices you think other people would look at and think whuh why whether it your go to movie you feel cozy rewatching over over or putting on to relax and turn your brain off to or something you leisurely rewatch all the way through every time it pops up on tv or before when you had tv or movie you just weirdly find cozy and comforting at all mine are zodiac and justice for all serpico and girl interrupted,"Some movies or shows that others might find strange, but that you find comforting to watch over and over again include Zodiac, Justice for All, Serpico, and Girl Interrupted. These films may be atypical choices for comfort viewing, but they provide you with a sense of warmth and relaxation whenever you watch them."
in the future future the mafia sends victims to the past to have loopers dispose of them so that the bodies no longer exist in the future future thus covering their tracks so given that they have the capability to send people to the past could not they just pull biff tannen and send someone back to do not know buy shitload of bitcoin on behalf of the mafia if they have this technology it seems like they would not need to be criminal organization since the ultimate goal of organized crime is money and there would be countless ways to accumulate an obscene fortune if you could send people with knowledge of the future relative present back to the past any takers on this,"The mafia sends victims to the past to be killed as a way to cover their tracks. Given their time travel capabilities, couldn't they just send someone back to the 1980s to invest in Bitcoin on their behalf, thus giving them a huge source of wealth legally and eliminating the need for criminal activity?"
this one had been on my radar for the longest time and recently got around to watching it pissed didn watch this sooner this is definitely one of the more unique takes on the apocalyptic societal collapse sub genre as most films focus on the collapse itself this one focuses on breakdown of social norms that would follow an apocalyptic event and the effects it has on people and their relationships and it fucking hilarious the dark humor matched with the talented cast and the awkward deadpan style of comedy make this film an absolute gem must watch for any comedy fans especially if you re fan of arrested development everyone in this film understands the assignment and absolutely kills it in their respective roles this cast has such great chemistry together the dialogue flows so naturally that oftentimes it fees like you re watching an actual group of friends having brunch if you check out any new films definitely give this one go solid pick for your next movie night rotten tomatoes link,"This movie is a unique take on the apocalyptic societal collapse genre, focusing on the breakdown of social norms that would follow such an event and its effects on people and their relationships. This film is packed with dark humor and is perfectly executed by a talented cast with great chemistry, making it a must-watch for fans of awkward deadpan comedy and those who enjoy movies that make you think."

am talking about those directors who were red hot and something happened that they just either stopped working or stopped having the visibility they once had for example gore verbinski he is director who knew how to direct good looking blockbusters who also knew how to make them if not good at least highly entertaining he knew how to shot and give enough info to the vfx teams to make absolutely impressive vfx shots davey jones is still one impressive piece of vfx after lone ranger his career ended am one wondering what he could have given to cinema if he was still working considering the state of blockbusters nowadays seeing how clueless most directors are on how to handle vfx jason reitman he was in hot streak with banger after banger with thanks for smoking juno and up in the air the he released tully and he slowly descended into oblivion alan pakula he died final destination style but he directed incredible movies in the and directing my all time fave all the president men wonder what he would have done late in his career joseph kosinski he was impressive in tron legacy movie will always defend was given oblivion and then disappeared to reappear last year for maverick reminding us who good he is directing blockbuster movies neil blomkamp red hot coming from district then after chappie his career collapsed even his alien project got cancelled allowing for someone else project to be produced instead of his one releasing next year who are your picks,"Many directors who were at the top of their game have faded away for various reasons. Some stopped getting jobs after a box office bomb, like Gore Verbinski after 'Lone Ranger,' while others lost their spark after a great run like Jason Reitman after 'Tully.' Some even died young, like Alan Pakula, leaving behind great films like 'All the President's Men,' and Joseph Kosinski, who is now back with 'Top Gun: Maverick.' 

Could their successors continue where they left off? 
Despite setbacks, many directors thrive again."
was just thinking the other day does there always have to be falling action probably not right think there some pretty sick endings that are right at the climax or atleast some with such little falling action that it basically does end on the climax not sure the only ones could think of were horror movies like maybe blair witch project but do not remember that movie well enough maybe also all the paranormal activities but be curious about any genre movie being like this feel like they would all be really intense scenes to not need to give people any more scenes after it,"Some movies may end abruptly without a falling action segment, climaxing with a big intense scene. However, many movies do have a falling action to help resolve the story and calm the audience down after a climax."
like being hot headed not dealing with their emotions being aggressive being unnecessarily violent you get the gist it for research about how maskulinity often gets portrait as good opposed to feminine traits no matter what the traits actually are so some examples would be nice as well actually am also open to discussions about this trope,"You are interested in learning about toxic masculinity and how traits that are inherently negative, such as poor emotional regulation, aggression, and violence, are attributed to males because of society's fixation on masculinity being superior to femininity. You would like to know some examples of toxic masculinity portrayed in society, and you want to have a discussion about this topic."
so as muslim one of my favorite comedy movies is borat its one of the only movies to make me cry laughing never found the movie to be islamaphobic found it to open people eyes to islamaphobia but never thought of the movie to be against islam used to like sacha baron cohen also because of him exposing islamaphobia in his show who is america also thought the dictator was silly stupid movie know it teased arab culture but just took it as comedy movie and learned to laugh at myself however sacha supports israel over this current conflict do not understand what his pov is is he actually islamaphobic but is trying to appeal to the muslim audience by exposing politicians on islamaphobia am arrogant for not seeing borat as being against muslims find his content funny but now feel guilty for it because his views are against the muslims yet his content shows mixed opinions in fact his content is extremely anti semitic,"You enjoy Borat because you think it exposes anti-Islamic sentiment, but now you feel conflicted because you've heard that the creator, Sacha Baron Cohen, is supportive of Israel in the current conflict and you're not sure if that means he's anti-Islamic.  You are wondering if you missed something anti-Islamic in Borat and whether Sacha's work is actually anti-Semitic."
anything that made your skin crawl or just made you look around uncomfortably scene or even title or even the synopsis on website movie that comes back into your mind randomly at times because it just stuck and glued to the back of your mind something that made you pause the movie and walk around for bit before going back and watching it again or made you pause it and delete it right after movie that just didn sit right with you and makes you frown worriedly or say wtaf every time you think about it,"A movie that made you feel uncomfortable, whether it was because of a particular scene, the title, or even just from reading the synopsis on the website, and that you can't stop thinking about because it disturbed you so much. You may have even paused the movie or stopped watching it entirely because it made you feel so uneasy."
there was an interesting post recently about movies in the that encapsulate the better than any others the last dragon the goonies the lost boys road house etc but what about movies that came out in the that are the opposite of time capsules imagine there are some great movies that are not commonly thought of when reminiscing of this decade,"Sure! Here is a possible paragraph for the topic you provided:

""Despite being known for its classic movies, the 80s also produced films that did not age well and are seldom remembered. These movies contrast the beloved time capsules like The Goonies and The Lost Boys with their lack of cultural resonance. This essay will discuss a few examples of these less remembered movies and what about them made them fall into obscurity."" 

Would you like help with anything else regarding this topic?"
how do all the events in this movie take place in one day idk what time he left think he got to the first store at either or and sunset is what pm the parade had to have started nlt pm sure much sooner let be generous and say he started at am he got to the parade at pm how he do it all in hrs the was the first store time spend in there got ticket for knocking over the cop bike then traffic to get to the next store that looks like either mall or really big ass department store all that had to take well over an hour then getting to the santa warehouse the ensuing fight cops coming and all that nonsense then driving back to downtown then few minutes in the diner the radio show fiasco assuming cab ride home after his car was vandalized then at least beer with the reindeer before taking cab to the parade there no way ok guess maybe it possible if we assume zero traffic feel the need to add that am aware overthinking it and not actually pressed it just that sometime nitpicking my favorite movies is fun edit ugh just notice my typo in the title that kills me,"You are correct that it would be very difficult for all of those events to take place in one day, even if there was no traffic. 

The timeline you established would require Barry to wake up at or around 6am to get to the first store by 8am, which is possible. However, the events after that would require him to move very quickly from one location to the next, with no time for meals or rest. 

This timeline also does not account for the time required to travel between locations, nor the time required to film those scenes. 

So, while it is possible that Barry could have achieved all of those events in one day, it would have been a very long and tiring day with no time for downtime or delays, and it may simply have been easier to film over multiple days."
marathoned the silent night deadly night series and it frankly hilarious how the sequels progressively have nothing to do with the original outside of the title and some scant references the first movie is fairly straightforward christmas slasher about killer dressed as santa but the sequels could not even keep the christmas aspect part iii is bizarre sci fi horror about blind psychic that only connected by featuring the same killer from the prior film who looks and acts nothing like he did before and the fourth film is weird religious witch mystery horror the fifth film at least returns to the christmas aspect but otherwise is completely unrelated if you just changed the titles and some of the character names you would never be able to connect these films to each other,"The Silent Night, Deadly Night series starts as a straightforward Christmas slasher movie, but the sequels stray further and further from the original, to the point where they have little in common with it other than the title and some recurring characters. The third movie is a sci-fi horror film about a blind psychic, and the fourth is a religious witch mystery. The only movie that revisits the Christmas theme is the fifth film, but it, too, is otherwise unrelated to the others in the series."
think this will be easier to explain with examples in groundhog day phil is inexplicably put in time loop until he achieved self actualization this is never explained and yet it is obvious that this was karmic phenomenon not freak accident in christmas carol scrooge is for whatever reason given an opportunity to learn to become more charitable man think this has been common trope in body swap films too if remember correctly in freaky friday the mother and daughter need to understand each other better before they re turned back going on was also about girl who needs to learn to appreciate her childhood while she can big with tom hanks basically looking for stories where the point of the film is for the protagonist to learn some lesson seemingly decreed by the universe itself suppose stories like the shack would work as there is little distinction between the universe and god in narrative sense,"You often see stories where a character is forced to learn a lesson, sometimes through supernatural or unexplained means. This can include films like ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Christmas Carol,"" ""Freaky Friday,"" and others, where characters must improve themselves in some way or risk suffering indefinitely. Stories like ""The Shack"" also fit this bill, as do many others."
curious what films you all like that are close to these films feel like repulsion and the tenant are more close than rosemary baby there pure psychological rather than supernatural conflict to those curious what films should check out to find films like these specifically repulsion and the tenant hopefully movies that have german expressionistic inspiration cool production design tricks more psychological than supernatural and of course in an apartment with people conspiring against the hero real or imagined,"You should watch 'Repulsion' and 'The Tenant' if you like movies that are pure psychological with conflict, like 'Rosemary's Baby'. Other films you might enjoy that have german expressionistic inspiration and an apartment setting with people conspiring against the hero are 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' , 'Nosferatu', or 'Pan's Labyrinth'."
has anyone ever realised that in the end of pineapple express dale denton seth rogan still has all of his felony curious how they progress with their lives as dale specifically has two hit and runs one being on police cruiser and more due to the car chase don think anyone is going to believe him if he explains himself and even if he did he still hit and ran those cars,"At the end of Pineapple Express, Dale Denton (Seth Rogan) is facing several felony charges, including hit and run, aggravated assault and possibly more due to a chain of events started by his attempt to avoid police capture. With no way to prove his innocence, it is likely he will face serious consequences."
hate nothing more than that silly trope of the villain losing and being backed into corner but either them telling the hero killing them would make them just as bad or the hero going no not like you especially when said villain have killed would kill hundreds or thousands of people like my guy offing hitler would not make anyone as bad as he was need to see some protagonists who say eh can live wthat and kick them into volcano or shark tank or traffic or monster maw or whatever,"The idea that villains, especially those who have taken thousands of lives, should be allowed to live or be given mercy by heroes simply because killing them would make the hero as bad as the villain frustrates you. You wish to see heroes who are not hesitant to kill villains, even those who pose no threat anymore."
in the santa clause movies more or less the first one how did charlie mom neil or scott before becoming santa not believe in santa if santa was bringing her kid presents every christmas know they didn believe in santa but scott brushed off all of the clatter on the roof like santa didn exist obviously santa had to bring charlie presents in the past did they just think that they just appeared and didn realize maybe this was explained in the movie but it just been something that ve had on my mind love to hear your feedback or theories about this,"In the Santa Clause movie, Charlie's mother, Neil, and Scott did not believe in Santa Claus even though Santa had been bringing presents to Charlie for years."

have discovered that enjoy playing movies that are set in the before times before bombastic scores car chases and explosions which have very minimal scores and very slow motion pacing and dialogue the movies first cow by kelly reichardt and the world to come starring vanessa kirby and katherine waterston fit the vibe perfectly as does jim jarmusch dead man from back in may not be describing the vibe right very quiet you can hear the rustling of leaves until character says something not much score or music just heard the hoot of an owl in the background that kind of thing so quiet the kids might get bored watching it but like it any others you can recommend that are like this,"You should check out 'First Cow' and 'The World to Come', which are slow-paced and have minimal scores, and 'Dead Man' by Jim Jarmusch for movies set in the old west which fit the description of movies that you enjoy.

so last night watched the film and as ever looked on imdb for trivia scrolling through it find that it cost an estimated to make was staggered know lot of huge blockbusters now cost upwards of but really could not see where that extra was coming from know there lot of effects and it period piece and harrison ford probably ain cheap but where did all the money go,"The movie enthusiast is astonished after learning that a certain blockbuster cost an estimated $300 million to make, and they cannot figure out where all that money went, considering that the production had minimal special effects and was a period piece. They wonder if the high cost could be attributed to the star, Harrison Ford, but still can't understand why the film would cost so much to make."
want to offer up fun discussion for the next several days if to give folks here an opportunity to branch out and hunt down some new christmas classics or just christmas ish movies to watch in the leadup to christmas what is the one christmas movie that you would recommend someone to watch every year my recommendation is the man who invented christmas dan stevens plays the part of charles dickens as he is endeavoring to create christmas carol during the conception of this book we see little influences and bases that serve to inspire and help dickens along in his writing christopher plummer makes an appearance as scrooge serving as the figurehead that spurs dickens on towards his book completion this movie seemed to tick the right boxes with me and serves as an annual christmas tradition alongside some of the other christmas carol adaptations pick up to watch such as the version scrooged the muppet version and even the hallmark version with sir patrick stewart feel free to drop in your suggestions below,"The movie ""The Man Who Invented Christmas"" is Dickens' tale of writing and publishing ""A Christmas Carol"", starring Dan Stevens as Dickens and Christopher Plummer as Scrooge. The film shows the influences that inspired Dickens, and the effort that went into creating his Christmas classic."
have heard many people say that is an annoying clich that needs to die out but have never seen that and watch movies fairly regularly do just watch films where that does not happen or is this just made up problem that rarely actually happens have seen the villain be spared but it usually when the hero has never killed anyone mostly in non violent fiction and children fairy tales,"You occasionally come across the cliché where the villain is spared at the end of a film, but it's rare for this to happen when the hero routinely kills enemies throughout the film. You've wondered whether this cliché irritates many filmgoers."
just watched krull after many years and noticed that it has lot of exactly the same music that was made for star trek ii the wrath of khan yes it the same composer but was wondering if anyone has noticed music borrowing that is this blatant naturally we would want to exclude movies that use classical music that was made long before any of the movies were conceived,"Have you noticed that the 1980 film Krull shares a lot of the same music with the 1982 film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, including themes composed by the same composer, James Horner? 

This observation excludes any instances of movies reusing classical music that predate the films in question."
just finally checked out this movie and thought it was just okay there few really funny sketches basketball truth or dare few sketches start out funny but lose steam the dude with neckballs and some were bad happy birthday but overall thought it was decent general consensus seems to be that it an abomination to comedy and cinema or it hidden comedy masterpiece that not for prudes instead just found movie with some good ideas and some good laughs but dragged in parts and didn live up to it full potential what your thoughts on movie,"You thought 'The Interview' was just okay: it had some funny sketches, but some lost steam and you feel like it didn't live up to its full potential.

ve watched bad santa pretty much every christmas since it came out and thought it was freaking hilarious this weekend ended up watching the unrated version and holy shit is it completely different movie ve never really thought about it before but was blown away by how different score and some additional scenes can damn near change the genre of the movie what used to be raunchy comedy with tons of laughs turned dark and depressing in an instant do not know if ll go back to the unrated version but now curious what other movies have similar outcome when comparing their unrated director cut etc versions also not talking about things like waterworld ulysses cut that version does not change the entire tone of the movie just adds to it so what are some other movies that are completely different when you watch an alternate version,Bad Santa is a comedy movie but its unrated version changes the genre completely turning it dark and depressing. This movie is an example of how alternate versions of movies can significantly change their tone.

it incredibly modern considering it was released in and handles the subject of men in women clothing with more sensitivity than lot of more modern movies in ace ventura jim carey pukes after finding out the hot chick has male genitals compare that to osgood well nobody perfect they also do not lean on making jokes about hey look at the dudes in dresses the humor comes from men realizing what women have to deal with daily and how obnoxious men are to them it dealt with sexual harassment before there was even term for it and it overall just legitimately funny movie really one of the best films out there,"Some find 'Some Like it Hot', released in 1959, to be ahead of its time in how it handles the subject of men in women's clothing with sensitivity, avoiding the reliance on jokes about men in dresses.

Overall, the film is one of the best and legitimately funny movies ever made."

has anyone watched monster the synopsis is very vague and guessing it good to go in blind taking some family members to watch with me all adults but wondering if anyone can tell me without spoilers whether there are any sexually explicit content in the film some nudity is fine but prefer avoiding awkwardly sitting through dragged out scenes,"There is a romantic relationship in the film, but it is not graphic or explicit. There is some mild nudity, but it is not unnecessarily dragged out and does not take away from the film. Monster is an excellent film to watch with adults as the nuanced storytelling and powerful acting will engage everyone."
so have been watching some of the early medieval action movies for the past few days one movie day by the way this was my first time watching all of these movies know it already late haha well ve have been free for few days and thought to watch some movies the first movie saw was knight tale heath leadger was phenomenal in the movie no need to say that but the whole supporting cast stole the show and the great selection of songs so after having enjoyed the movie thought to me that really interested in the medieval movies the setting the complex political plots the great war sequence and all the production values so the obvious choice would be watching some ridley scott movie that and kingdom of heaven was on my watchlist for some time mean how the director cut was more of complete version compared to the theatrical released version and all that so before watching the movie had idea like how this movie would have grandeur war sequences spectacular actions and whatnots pretty clear to say that was fool about thinking about these mean the movie is exactly opposite of what thought the movie would be so thought to share some of my views and appreciation of the movie mean it would be correct to say that is one huge simplified to an extent history lesson made for general audience the all around gritty atmosphere due to war was already well established from very first shot of the movie the very first quote from the film she was denied the cross for suicide but buried at the center of the cross roads was very well written line gives audience the idea about the world we are about to experience it also sort of shows how the man would just do anything during the period and justify it in the name of god and religion it also gives somewhat neutral view in movie with different religion also in scene where ibelin comments about the muslim prayers in the port sounds like our prayers shows how he was kind of he was acting without any agenda always using brain before blade and able to see through the person man of principles also how effectively he was used to show all the different events occurring at the time not as heroic figure but more as plot device do not know if saying it right to walk through the different events just want to say about how little portion of the movie is with any action sequence that how well done the dialogues and all the scenes were mean what can say about the dialogues this movies has some huge amount of memorable one and how well the playout in scene that what found problem in the movies with huge amount of quotes how hard they try to makes those feel convincing and make them work not in in this particular movie all of them were flawless also edward norton role of king baldwin iv is absolute phenomenal it was one of crucial character in the movie and difficult one he have to wear mask all the time so he was already dealing with the trickiest part about how to convey the emotion but the way he does it so easily and so convincingly the character and his portrayal becomes one of memorable one in the movie that all what wanted to say about the movie it already going to longer post so guess will stop here watching the film can say those were some of the best hrs have spent in movie definitely worth it and learnt something new in movie will definitely check out some other scott movie like the last duel and the gladiator yes ve not watched that one yet most probably the only one to not have seen it also if anyone want to recommend any other movie feel free to say so thank you,"The viewer has been on a medieval movie kick, recently watching Knight Tale and Kingdom of Heaven. They were impressed by the acting in Knight Tale, particularly by Heath Ledger, as well as the movie's songs and supporting cast. They were looking forward to a similar experience with Kingdom of Heaven, a movie they thought would have lots of action and drama. However, they found it to be more focused on dialogue and history than expected. Despite this, they still enjoyed the movie due to its gritty atmosphere, intriguing quotes, and memorable characters, particularly Edward Norton's performance as King Baldwin IV. They would recommend the movie and intend to watch other medieval movies like The Last Duel and Gladiator."

saw dune and thought it was decently entertaining but something was missing it seemed so empty like long version of the trailer so much of the runtime is wasted on long visual shots and next to nothing on dialogue or worldbuilding which for me is the main appeal of the book no quirky planetology from kines no interplanetary politics not much mysterious bene gesserit stuff not much water spice economics barely any development of the relationship between paul and yueh making his choice have less impact no lore backstory explanations of concepts such as mentats instead they put tons of effort into making duncan idaho look badass,"Dune was entertaining but lacked dialogue and world-building. The movie spent a lot of time on long shots but lacked the development of key elements from the book, such as politics, certain characters, their relationships, and the mysterious elements of the world. There was also insufficient exposition of backstories and concepts such as mentats."
just read discussion switching from lotr to inside out here and thought it would be fun to have frodo emotions comment on what happening in an inside out like manner also wondering how drug use would be depicted in an inside out film but the emotions of characters from films like spun or requiem of dream would probably not make for good film themselves edit after thinking about it for while little miss sunshine could be fun with all characters emotions visible pretty on the nose though with suicidal character finding joy that paul dano arc the grandpa doing coke etc,"You could do an Inside Out style film on various Drug using Film characters and have their emotions voiced by the respective characters from Inside Out, Frodo from LOTR and various other characters. An example would be to have the emotions of Paul Dano's character from Little Miss Sunshine voiced by the characters in Inside Out."

was recently watching movie on netflix called moxie and the male interest is seth who is very respectful and feminist male lead what mean by this is that he supports his love interest in everything is not forceful and is anti sexist sticking up against misogyny and things like that to elaborate more the character looking for is not just nice and not sexist but actually anti sexist,"You are looking for a specific movie/television character called Seth from the show Moxie on Netflix, who is a feminist and respectful male lead. He is anti-sexist and sticks up against misogyny."
get why he in big name budget blockbusters but he so wooden imo he plays his typecast role well enough somewhat sure of himself but awkward and dorky nonetheless but never find any reason to genuinely champion for his characters it sounds like he always putting on some sort of acting voice and his delivery always lands slightly flat in inflection and emotionally the new trailer for his upcoming starring role the american society of magical negroes looks fantastic and personally can wait to watch it get the feeling that know exactly what to expect out of his performance though the heartfelt recital of the admittedly cliche line even though we might never see each other again need you to know that what we had was real alone is delivered in such forced manner that it feels like an abusive partner attempting to convince their significant other to stay with them im worried his performance will hamper the film but the film itself will do well enough to keep him household name and continue his trend of being the most insufferable part of otherwise great films his performances come across as if he constantly feigning we as viewers know it doesn personally affect you or your life outside of the set but that doesn need to come across onscreen im open to hearing why other people find him interesting admit that he attractive and looks the part of dashing dork to tee he just doesn do it for me man,"The narrator does not understand why this certain actor is in big-budget movies, because to them, the actor comes across as wooden and awkward. They are concerned that the actor's performance will hamper an upcoming film, but believe the film itself will do well enough to keep the actor a household name. 
The narrator does not feel invested in this actor's performances and finds the actor to be insufferable in most films. 
They are open to hearing why others may find this actor interesting, but do not personally feel that way. 
Overall, the narrator has a negative opinion of this actor's talent and believes that the actor's performances come across as forced and unconvincing."

christmas carol is one of my favourite stories ever told it seems year after year the same handful of adaptations gets mentioned as the best muppets george scott alastair sim bill murray this one is my second favourite but never see the musical adaptation with albert finney mentioned it my personal favourite retelling of the story it lavishly filmed gothic shockingly dark legitimately creepy adaptation even when it does the musical thing and breaks into song and dance it seems so earned that it just fits within the atmosphere of the production and some of those numbers are downright catchy then there albert finney this dude was when he played scrooge in this shout out to the make up department because you legit would never believe that man in is mid honestly unbelievable makeup and performance he looks sounds acts like an old crotchety man should ve got some kind of awards consideration also just the atmosphere feels so chilly like you re just wanting to get home and feel warm again on winter night the production design is just incredible think this adaptation really remembers that christmas carol is ghost story above all which many of the adaptations seem to miss mostly slightly but it makes huge difference christmas carol is creepy and brooding and this adaptation gets to those feelings the best,"The Albert Finney musical adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" is underrated and deserves mention alongside the likes of ""The Muppets,"" ""George Scott,"" and ""Alastair Sim"" versions of the story.  It is dark and brooding with incredible production design and musical numbers, enhanced by Albert Finney's incredible makeup and performance as Scrooge.  This adaptation remembers that Christmas Carol is ultimately a ghost story and taps into that effectively."
to begin with ve always been fascinated by dreams and surrealism ve always loved donnie darko and david lynch films so did not mind the ambiguous narrative at all as far as the execution goes can honestly say that loved how real it all felt the guerilla film making and the presence of real companies made the whole thing very grounded in our reality which made the surreal stuff more believable may be alone in this but seeing someone plugged into strange machines and experimented on by an android becomes another level of bizarre when the machines have giant siemens logo on them and when the lab is inside real location in disneyland ve noticed this too with haruki murakami books murakami likes to reference brands in his stories saying things like he pulled out marlboro he ordered perrier and we drove past mcdonalds not sure what his personal reason for doing it is but for me it creates sense that the protagonist inhabits the same universe that do probably because referencing brands is rare in fiction legal troubles probably it feels more like the memoirs of real person did not think roy abramsohn acting was bad he looked genuinely distressed when he lost sarah some people point to few grimaces he made in the beginning of the film but personally found them funny in campy leon kennedy sort of way the whole theme of sexual frustration reminded me of silent hill as strange as that comparison may be liked some small cheesy details like the fact that when jim was electrocuted in the crotch you could see his pelvis and femur bones in cartoonish disney like fashion also liked how small bits of lore re emerge later like the cat flu tbh missed it before looked up some video essays can see how it not everyone cup of tea but overall thought it was an interesting little project,"The narrator enjoys the film 'Brazil' because its ambiguous narrative and mix of realism and surrealism resonate with them. They especially enjoy the guerilla filmmaking and the inclusion of real-world logos and locations, like Siemens and Disneyland, which add to the film's bizarre tone. The narrator also appreciates the acting of Roy Abramsohn and the film's themes of sexual frustration. They also enjoy small details like the cartoonish depiction of bones when Jim is electrocuted. Overall, the narrator finds 'Brazil' to be an interesting and unique project."
after watching the first movie my theory was it was the rapture as brutal as killing themselves one way or another it not torture just the quickest way to death for anything viable to do so near them at that moment my theory in the first movie was the majority who die eventually accept death sort of like after rapture beginning of purgatory the ones who can see but not die are deemed unworthy or it could be everything explained but flipped opposite not entirely sure then the second movie came out this is where my theory bites the dust honestly have no idea at this point how the people who can see see the main character in the second film is troubled to be sure but he eventually does good by helping if they left the first film as is could make sense of it but now with the second what the actual iddlesticks know this topic has been thrown around lot figured with my own thoughts you guys could work on or maybe see things differently all the questions we have why did all of sudden these creatures appear is it lovecraft style where our human minds can only comprehend something so much when we see something so surreal our human minds cannot comprehend and makes us go mad by lovecraft it is easy to remove the mind from harping on the lost illusion of immortality the oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown the second film either contradicts itself compared to the first or there is something we are missing like said earlier my theory went down the drain once the second film came out now at loss genuinely curious what you guts think appreciate your time reading and your input,"The narrator watched the first movie and formed a theory that the characters who saw ghosts were experiencing the rapture and punishing themselves for their sins. They theorize that the ghosts represent humanity's fear of dying and inability to accept death. The narrator has difficulty accepting their theory after watching the second film in the series, and is curious what other viewers think about the films and their meaning."

this isn really serious suggestion but as someone who struggles with faces there have been many times watching movie and there is dramatic reveal of character and just thinking wait who is that demand that all characters wear distinctive outfit or have giant scar on their face if there is going be big identity reveal moment in movie,"Many times in films, there are pivotal moments when a character's identity is revealed, but because of my face blindness, I can't always recognize them, so distinctive outfits or facial markings would help with these reveals."
indiana jones sucked exorcist sucked star wars regardless if you enjoyed them still were not as groundbreaking as the originals new jumanjis have completely lost their magic jurassic world series started off well enough and completely went off cliff star trek picard is awful not movie but still consider it requel matrix was alright if you liked the meta angle scream was decent but has issues definitely better than has there been an actually great requel yet besides bladerunner trying really hard to remember any recent good ones and seriously drawing blank edit the first halloween requel was awesome forgot about that one because the sequels were so bad,"The following franchises, in the opinion of the speaker, failed to achieve the same level of success in their subsequent installments as they did with their original films: Indiana Jones, Exorcist, Star Wars, Jumanji, Jurassic World, Star Trek, Scream, and Matrix.

heavy spoilers for his movies ofcourse but in villeneuve movies there is recurring theme of someone thinking they are destined to achieve or do something but ultimately either they have been deceived from the start or they fail at the task sicario the main character kate thought she was being inducted into special black ops team because she was top notch operator turns out she was just being manipulated because they need domestic agent to commit extrajudicial activities bladerunner officer thought his memories were real and that he was birthed turns out he just another replicant destined to die dune paul atreides is set up to be the chosen one in the books and the movies but actually he will become crazy hermit as he saw vision of the future and wanted no part in its brutality he instead passes the chosen one status to his son future wormlord note that have not seen most of villeneuve movies but if anyone here has please let me know if this theme appears in his other movies,"In Denis Villeneuve's movies, there is a recurring theme of individuals being deceived or failing in their quests due to a misinterpretation of their purpose or ability. This is notably seen in Sicario, where Kate's belief that she's being inducted into a special team is exploited for her skills, Blade Runner 2049, where Officer K believes he's human only to discover he's a replicant, and Dune, where Paul Atreides believes he's destined to lead but ultimately becomes a hermit after seeing a vision of the future."
in glass onion running gag throughout the film involved the mona lisa getting locked down every time there was loud sound upon rewatching it tonight while slightly high on shrooms realized that makes no sense because it should lock down once and stay locked down until the failsafe button is pressed we never see it pressed during the scene where dave bautista phone is blowing up with google alerts is there something in the script missed,"While re-watching 'Glass Onion' on shrooms, you realized that the Mona Lisa's lockdown procedure makes no sense.

over the past couple of weeks ran through three classics that had never gotten around to flashdance footloose and sixteen candles was born in the early so aware of the aesthetic and what was acceptable and popular ve seen other teen classics back to the future ferris bueller goonies karate kid etc so not unlearned of the genre period footloose thought the movie was alright but did not really get it popularity until the montage when ren teaches willard how to dance that when the movie sings and you really get the joy of dancing that and the music think are what made it so popular if anyone has further insight please share flashdance this one to me seems to coast on its star the music and those two shots in the beginning and end otherwise this movie was mess it has to be one of the most unintentionally toxic relationships committed to film nick and alex relationship starts with nick threatening to fire alex if she does not go out with him that their meetcute she sees him helping woman into his car and she throws brick through the window of his house he helps her get an audition and she gets pissed and jumps out of his car in tunnel besides all that could not even concentrate on the final dance because that double looked nothing like jennifer beals the choreography was great though sixteen candles liked this one the best and it made sense why molly ringwald and anthony michael hall became stars in this decade it was not great and little haphazard but guess it was popular because of the whole one crazy party night of this generation vibe seems most decades have one was that the reason it was popular if anyone who was teen when those films were released can shed little light on their enduring popularity it would be much appreciated thanks,"You ask about the enduring popularity of 1980's teen films, specifically mentioning 'Flashdance', 'Footloose' and 'Sixteen Candles'. While you appreciated 'Footloose' for its dancing scenes and music, you found 'Flashdance' to be a mess, with a toxic relationship at its core. You preferred 'Sixteen Candles' among the three, finding that it made sense for the rise of its stars, Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. You wonder if those who were teens when these films were released can share their perspectives on why these films remain popular today."

honest question are there any comedians making movies in hollywood that are not re tread from snl truly cannot stand will farrell adam sandler ben stiller and company more into witty quips than satirical slapstick it an older movie but as good as it gets is one of my favorite comedies for example anyway suggestions,"You should check out some of these comedians and films if you're looking for alternatives to Saturday Night Live alumni like Will Farrell, Adam Sandler, and Ben Stiller, and enjoy sharp, witty comedy more than satirical slapstick:

1. Richard Pryor: A hugely influential stand-up comedian who transitioned to film, known for his frank and observational style. Films like ""Blazing Saddles,"" ""The Jerk,"" and ""Blue Collar"" showcase his talent.

2. Woody Allen: A master of cerebral, dialogue-driven comedies. His extensive filmography includes ""Annie Hall,"" ""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" and ""Manhattan.""

3. Christopher Guest: Known for his mockumentary style, Guest and his regular collaborators, including Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, and Fred Willard, offer satirical depictions of everyday characters in films like ""Best in Show,"" ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" and ""Waiting for Guffman.""

4. Mel Brooks: A pioneer of parody and satire. His films, including ""The Producers,"" ""Blazing Saddles,"" and ""Young Frankenstein,"" offer hilarious takes on classic film tropes and genres.

my daughter loves encanto so ve been watching it with her ve been wondering why the house could be so cruel as to deny five year old child gift pretty sure it because the house is part of pact that abuela made with demon the following is my theory abuela watched her village and husband slaughtered she begged for protection and vengeance unspecified miracle intervened and saved her and the village the miracle asks for abuela to promise her children and all her posterity to getting vengeance on the soldiers abuela agrees to the contract casita is created and the children are given powers to rebuild the village agriculture prophesy and healing the village grows and the next generation is given powers to infiltrate and destroy the soldiers and the government of columbia shape shifting super strength creating plants and super hearing abuela gets complacent in her contract with the demon and focuses on governing the village with her children the demon is displeased that abuela is not following her end of the bargain and overthrowing the government of colombia as threat to abeula and to hedge its bet the demon denies the child mirabelle gift mirabelle is ostricized from her family and filled with resentment perfect for making new pact abeula is shamed and loses power within the village to the wealthy guzman family after the mirabelle debacle abuela recommits to the demon she pushes her children harder to overthrow the colombian government through brunos prophesy abuela sees that she will break her pact thing that will cost her soul she banishes bruno to keep him from telling others about the prophesy the demon prepares to make pact with mirabelle that would make her the leader of the family in abuela place the demon pushes mirabelle over the edge by giving the last madrigal grand child extremely powerful gift to control all animals then the demon severs the pact destroying the house and taking away the powers weak and vulnerable abuela tells mirabelle about the pact the village rallies around mirabelle and rebuilds the house mirabelle forms new pact with the demon the powers are restored to the family but they are governed by mirabelle who they have ostricized and abused for years the demon now has his army and leader that is not afraid to sacrifice her family to fulfill the pact,"Here is a short summary of your theory:

The Encanto house is cruel due to a pact made by Abuela with a demon. Abuela was saved by an unspecified miracle after her village and husband were slaughtered. She agrees to the contract which creates Casita and gives her children powers, Abuela becomes complacent and the demon is displeased. To regain control, the demon begins to manipulate events which leads to Mirabelle being denied a gift and ultimately ostracized. After Abuela nearly breaks the pact, she banishes Bruno to protect the family. The demon gives Mirabelle a cruel gift and then destroys the house, taking the powers. Mirabelle makes a new pact which restores the powers to the family, but they are now governed by Mirabelle who has been abused by the family for years."
feel like many films plots maybe even most at least where it concerns action films and thrillers only work because of incompetence and hesitation on the part of the villains it been bugging me in the last couple ve watched so wondering if you could make some recommendations for movies where the villains absolutely do not screw around for example while do not think it perfect movie dragged across concrete is good example that really brings across how utterly ruthless and calculating the antagonists are,"You are bothered by the fact that in many action films and thrillers the villain's incompetence or hesitation contributes to the plot. You are looking for movie recommendations where the villains are ruthless and calculating, and where their actions drive the plot forward without hesitation. ""Dragged Across Concrete"" is an example of such a movie."
apologize for asking this question yet third time first time must have broke some obscure rule and my post was removed without telling me why so who knows maybe it will get deleted again several people responded to that first post but ve been sick and did not have chance to look at the answers then as said the post got deleted ve had few wonderful souls tell me what the movie is about correct my spelling letter in the entire post tell me the movie is was not released dubbed or with subtitles when already found reviews where the reviewers offered their opinions on the translated versions wish they had offered means of contact but they did not tell me what the title means ve heard the third times the charm let see if it true if there is someone out there who can actually answer my question with link site or something similar would greatly appreciate it ve found several instances of the film in french but that does not help me for those who are interested here is the imdb link,"I am seeking the English language movie title that corresponds to a particular French film, for which I have an IMDb link. I apologize for my previous posts getting deleted without explanation, but I would still like to know if this title has been released with subtitles or dubbing, and also what the title means if anyone knows. 

Can anyone provide a definitive answer with a link to a site where I can find the movie?

noticed this movie is out in my town not la or ny or any othe rmajor market right now but have heard zero buzz about it it seems like given the subject matter movie star director and bestselling book of it all it would at least make dent tbh read the book and found it good but did wonder how the subject matter would translate also since none of it was actually filmed in washington that does kind of damper it,"You haven't heard much about this new movie, which is odd because usually when a film has big names involved, it would at least make some buzz in major cities. You read the book it's based on and enjoyed it, but you wonder how the subject matter will translate to the screen since it wasn't filmed in Washington State."
ive been looking over the internet and didn find anything about it so might go crazy we just watched with the kids its been years didnt watch it when looks for snacks in the fridge and throws stuff on the floor my husband mentions how it makes no sense that he is clearly from and advanced civilization but throws stuff on the floor when he doesnt like it tell him well remember the last scene referring to the fact that is child without wanting to spoil anything he then goes oh yeah then the last scene comes and is alone in his ship am crazy or it used to be that when entered the ship we used to see his silouette and other silouettes much taller members of his species and that made us conclude was just child,"You are questioning the details of a movie you recently watched with your family. Your husband is confused by a particular scene in which a character, despite being from a technically advanced civilization, throws food on the floor when displeased. You recall a closing scene in which the character is alone in his ship, and you wonder if you are mistaken in remembering previous shots that showed him accompanied by taller individuals of his species. 

Did you perhaps imagine this detail, or are you misremembering the plot? 

I am happy to help you ponder this film question but would need more information to provide a definite answer regarding your memory of the plot details."

while talking about the upcoming planet of the apes movie was discussing whether or not there were any trilogies that had strong fourth movie after it for this was trying to think of ones that specifically had trilogy focused on protagonist that was still going to be the protagonist for the fourth movie planet of the apes obviously does not fit this since caesar is not the protagonist of the fourth movie it his son although am excited to see maurice this is part of the reason why actually have hope for the movie while thinking of strong fourth entry that fits this criteria has mostly alluded me so far the only answer have come up with has been toy story and the reason why think that is is because for the arc they go with the anti theme of the trilogy was curious if anyone had any other examples that would fit this this is specifically for trilogies also not going to count endgame while it is technically the th avengers movie it has so many other films that lead up to it and most of the character arts that it resolves are mostly prevalent in those characters individual films and it would not be fair to count it,"You are looking for trilogies where the fourth movie is strong and still focuses on the original protagonist.

love when directors producers take something that supposed to be terrifying and then make it into something fun and silly while still continuing the dark undertones like to imagine if something really did go horribly wrong that how it would go it wouldn be as epic and cool as we would think ex shaun of the dead or the last man on earth or even like the blackening bodies bodies bodies,"Some movies or shows can take a premise that is scary or unsettling and transform it into something humorous while keeping the darker elements intact. This genre combines horror and comedy, often imagining how characters would react to a surreal, apocalyptic situation in a relatable and entertaining way. Examples include ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""The Last Man on Earth.""

for me it the funniest film ever but the scene when gene wilder goes into the cell with the monster for me one of the greatest film scenes comedic or otherwise just before he says hello handsome he mumbles something to himself anybody know what he says know every line apart from this,"It is one of Gene Wilder's funniest moments in a film, but what is he saying right before he says ""Hello, handsome"" to the monster in Young Frankenstein? 

This comedy classic moment has been the subject of much speculation, and yet there is no definitive answer to this question. 

Although there are many differing interpretations, it is clear that Gene Wilder is improvising, and the intention is to add to the humour and absurdity of the situation. 

Whatever he's saying, it's certainly funny, and contributes to the brilliance of this cinematic moment."

You can watch 'Christmas or Mine' on Amazon Prime."
there are some films that have nothing to do with the holidays but find that enjoy them much more around this time and they get me in the holiday spirit think it has to do with them being released in theaters at the end of the year so it conjures up those feelings and memories from when first watched them three movies that enjoy more this time of year are the hateful eight the lord of the rings the return of the king and star wars the force awakens ve also found about time plays much better near the end of the year,"Some films, like ""The Hateful Eight,"" ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" and ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" are better viewed during the holidays even though they aren't necessarily holiday movies. Perhaps it's because they were released during this season or because of the memories they evoke, but you can't help but feel in the holiday spirit when watching them. Another film that fits this description is ""About Time."

I also have a soft spot for movies that involve the military. Do you have any suggestions?"
everyone keeps bringing up comedy actors turned dramatic like tom hanks in the but then by the time he did philadelphia he went more serious or michael keaton when he was doing comedies as well but batman pretty much changed the map for him as serious actor but what about the other way two that comes to mind are leslie nielsen and john reilly lot of people don know that nielsen did dramatic works before airplane but when he did that movie he been pretty much the poster man for spoof movies jcr was of course frequent collaborator with pta such as hard eight and magnolia but when he first did talladega nights he stared to be like the one half duo of ferrell and reilly,"While actors like Tom Hanks and Michael Keaton have transitioned from comedic roles to dramatic roles successfully, comedic actors who have successfully transitioned to more serious roles like Leslie Nielsen and John C.

as the title describes cherry on top scene is one where the scene is technically not necessary for the movie to make sense or to have satisfying conclusion but one that greatly enhances movie my example is in die hard without getting spoilers the scene with sergeant al at the end is technically not needed for the movie to be great but his scene is so incredible that it makes the movie that much more satisfying at the end,"A cherry on top scene is a term used to describe a scene in a movie that is not essential for the plot or conclusion of the film, but adds a pleasant surprise or an extra touch that enhances the movie's enjoyment.  An example of this is the Sgt. Al scene in Die Hard.  
Are there any other movie scenes you would like to analyze?"
for me it probably tie between the crowd of people who say vfx has gotten worse over the years while they cherrypick examples and ignore avatar the way of water existence and then the other is people who say that hollywood does not make original movies anymore while the theater is generally full with original movies that are barely making any money because no one is going to see them,"Some people complain that visual effects have deteriorated over the years while selectively ignoring the critically acclaimed Avatar: The Way of Water, whereas others argue that the film industry no longer produces original content, despite theaters largely screening original films that struggle to draw audiences due to their lack of familiarity."
am rewatching the holiday and once again find it amusing that the bad guys were both in knight tale which is my favorite movie even though they do not have any scenes together am always like damn jocelyn turned out to be bad bitch just like adhemar just wondering if someone else thought about this connection while watching the holiday,"You enjoy noticing connections in movies you watch, such as the fact that the ""bad guys"" in both The Holiday and Knight Tale were played by the same actors, Jocelyn and Adhemar, even though they don't share any scenes together in The Holiday.

the silent world is ocean documentary made by legendary documentarian jacques cousteau like many of cousteau film this film focuses primarily on the ocean the film is noteworthy for being one of the first movies that featured underwater cinematography to be shot in color resulting in some truly beautiful imagery in fact to this day the film is still considered one of the most visually beautiful documentaries ever made however nowadays in addition to it pretty imagery the film is also known for another reason the shocking amount of cruelty displayed to the marine life of course there the infamous scene where cousteau blows up coral reef to get fish samples something that he even acknowledges is wrong in the movie however there is also the scene where he rides turtle and makes it very difficult for the turtle to surface for air and then there the scene where whale is severely harmed in an attempt to attract sharks and then killing the sharks who responded to it as an animal lover these scenes are pretty hard to watch it like the cove before the cove was thing even cousteau himself would come to regret the decisions he made in the movie he would go onto become vocal advocate for ocean conservation and would express regret for the things he did although the film is still recognized for it significance to film and for being visually striking the film is still considered extremely hard to watch due to it cruelty to the point where it actually was featured in an earlier post made about critically acclaimed movies that are hated now,"'The Silent World' is a beautiful yet difficult to watch documentary about the ocean. It is aesthetically striking due to its underwater cinematography in colors. Nevertheless, it is notorious for the cruel treatment of marine life for film purposes, which included blowing up a coral reef and harming turtles and whales. Following the release of the documentary, its director Jacques Cousteau became an advocate for ocean conservation. 
Despite its historical significance, the documentary is still hard to watch because of the cruelty toward animals displayed in it."

Whether it is through a chance meeting, a needed exchange, or some other plot device, these two films intersect in a way that impacts their plots."

thinking of all those horror movies that have the single struggling mother the angsty teenage girl etc they always have the same archetypes assume because it makes the arc little cleaner for the characters what are some archetypes that have been subverted can you subvert those archetypes if they are grieving from trauma or loss perhaps one could put up front of humor when underneath they are in deep pain and suffering,"Certain archetypes appear often in films, such as the single mother or the troubled teenage girl, because they provide easy narratives. However, these stereotypes can often be detrimental to more nuanced character development. Can you think of any examples where these types have been subverted, and how a character's grief or trauma could be explored instead?"

years ago watched the cloverfield movie and for some reason loved it yesterday watched cloverfield lane not knowing the movie belongs to cloverfield please don judge me however not knowing that the movie belongs to cloverfield it changed the entire atmosphere of the movie for me cannot describe it without spoiling but was terrified the entire time confused and didn know what to believe so if you never seen cloverfield please watch cloverfield lane first,"Although they enjoyed the Cloverfield movie, this person recommends watching Cloverfield Lane first because not knowing that it is part of the Cloverfield franchise adds to the suspense and confusion of the film."
there many film that has done this but ve noticed audiences are disliking it recently when big reveals in films are backed up with visual flashbacks often accusing the director writer of not trusting the viewer to figure it out two major examples of this are joker with it whole arthur was just imagining his girlfriend twist and saltburn with the pileup of oliver various plans it common trope that tv tropes calls once more with clarity and many films do it with some going further than others on the one hand get feeling like you ve figured out reveal and not wanting the movie to straight up show it get not wanting to feel like the film thinks you re stupid get that sometimes the flow of scene can feel better without them some of the best reveals in movie history do not have these moments and they work fine without them however do feel like these complaints can be kinda trivial even when talking about huge reveals if these are just brief second clips then does it really matter if the film allowed itself to be bogged down in long flashbacks explaining things then that could make difference but if they re short then how much do they stick out plus feel like they can add impact to reveal also for us to actually see what was under our nose the entire time can give the reveal punch that it might be missing if it were just said though can totally understand the opposite and sometimes these visual flashbacks also are not just simple explanations they can have something extra on top of it that adds more than if they were not there also for as much as we like to think of the audience of movie as being intelligent think the age of the internet has proven that people who watch films can miss things they can misinterpret they can miss stuff that blatantly clear whilst do not think films should be made directly to appeal to those people we cannot pretend that everyone is as smart as we think we are what do you think,"Some viewers feel that when a film relies on big reveals or twists and backs them up with visual flashbacks, it assumes the audience is too dumb to figure it out. However, others believe that these flashbacks can enhance the viewer's experience by showing them something they may have missed, and can be especially impactful. Do you think visual flashbacks are a good technique for filmmakers?"

earlier this year steven spielberg received the berlinale honorary golden bear in honour of the th anniversary of schindler list felt that sharing this speech is appropriate especially considering that spielberg discusses the holocaust and his jewish heritage steven spielberg berlin speech well how do follow that how do follow bono and the beautiful context and contextualizing the entire experience of my life bono that was one of your most beautiful songs thank you thank you so much please let me begin by thanking the berlin film festival the directors of the festival mariette thank you rissenbeek and carlo chatrian and the head of the deutsche kinomatic rainer rother are you here ok great great and the minister of culture and media claudia roth thank you claudia we sat right next to each other tonight and all the patrons and all the staff of the festival for this truly overwhelming honour ll talk to you about the bear little bit later ve got little story about bear but we ll get to that later so years ago albert einstein theorized that time is not constant it speeds up it slows down maybe it even curves back on itself and physicists have now proven that einstein was right which is exciting but maybe little less exciting for people who have reached the age ve reached because by the time you re you probably already know that year old einstein hit the nail on the head because time only appears to be measurable by clocks and calendars time is really just trick of the mind and it trick of the light ve been directing long time six decades but it feels to me like directed duel and jaws last year at knew lot more about moviemaking than did when was and directed my first feature film at but the anxieties and the uncertainties and the fears that tormented me as began shooting duel have stayed vivid for years as if no time has passed luckily for me the electric joy feel on the first day of work as director is as imperishable as my fears because there no place more like home for me than when working on set the truth of my life is contained in my fears and my joys and my work and in my truest home my truest home in my family home far more than hours and days and years ve apparently traversed as you call that to attention quite beautifully tonight and in falling in love with beautiful brilliant woman an extraordinary artist my soul companion my kate right there kate who since has made so much of me possible and then becoming the father of our children in my heart all these things happened yesterday even though kate and have been together for years my kids are adults now and several with kids of their own and grandpa incredible though it seems to me it no less incredible to me that my mum and dad are gone leah my mom died in and three years later lost my dad now no one who becomes newly minted orphan can escape the remembrance of things past for most of my very busy life ve been on bullet train but change and loss it accumulates til you realise that more and more of your life resides in memory and that why decided with my latest film the fabelmans it was time to look back at my early life at the world was born into and emerged out of so that could make my way make my mistakes and make my movies and because made my movies get to be in berlin tonight accepting this overwhelming honour for lifetime achievement which makes me feel little bit bashful about being recognised for lifetime achievement the bashfulness comes mostly from being aware that haven achieved anything as solo act all my films have been collaborations with great artists and so of course my life my family is collaboration now also feel little alarmed to be told ve lived lifetime because not finished cheers from audience not finished want to keep working want to keep learning and discovering and scaring the shit out of myself and sometimes the shit out of you ve got to get back to some of those earlier scarier movies but that another story for later on as long as there joy in it for me and as long as my audience can find joy and other human values in my films reluctant to ever say that wrap to be honest like to beat manoel de oliveira record and direct my last film when my dad my father arnold lived to so theoretically got the genes and maybe got the luck but only einstein knows only he knows for sure now like every other filmmaker owe an incalculable debt to german cinema from murnau and ernst lubitsch to douglas sirk and robert wiene and fritz lang the pioneers enlargers and refiners of how film reveals truth among the directors of my era ve been challenged ve been goaded inspired by fassbinder herzog margarethe von trotta wim wenders wolfgang petersen volker schlondorff thomas tykwer if this honour means that my work has found home in germany then tonight feel like home too this honour has particular meaning for me because jewish director and like to believe that this is small moment in much larger ongoing effort of healing the broken places of history what jews call tikkun olam the repairing and restoring of the world so established the shoah foundation in because convinced that what historian yosef hayim yerushalmi wrote is true the opposite of justice is not injustice the opposite of justice is forgetting reconciliation is possible only when we remember what happened and the shoah foundation video history archive has gathered the testimony of survivors of the holocaust as well as testimonies of atrocities and genocides all around the world and germany has long been an essential partner in the shoah foundation work private citizens and the german government and the berlin film festival have joined us in gathering and interviewing witnesses and introducing documentaries in spreading educational materials and helping us make our archives widely available throughout germany and western europe the german people have shown themselves willing to read their country history to confront its lessons regarding antisemitism bigotry xenophobia the harbingers of the holocaust other countries including my own can learn lot from the courageous determination of the germany people to act to prevent fascists from seizing power nation can be called just only if it refuses the convenient amnesia that tempts all of us and after the th century maybe no nation should flatter or delude itself that it deserves to be called just but we shouldn deny the possibility of justice we shouldn stop pursuing it that pursuit is our best hope of finding meaning in life and that begins with remembering so so stand here in berlin accepting the golden bear and have to confess that bears really scare me more even than sharks but it good to be scared as well as grateful bashful and alarmed so thank you for this golden bear that bellows at me look back look where you ve been and can imagine more meaningful occasion to be thus admonished thank you,"Steven Spielberg receives the Berlinale honorary golden bear and delivers a speech in which he discusses his Jewish heritage, the importance of acknowledging history, and the joy and fear of experiencing life and directing films. He acknowledges the influence of German cinema pioneers on his work and the importance of the Shoah Foundation's work in collecting and preserving testimony of survivors of the Holocaust and other genocides. He concludes by expressing his gratitude for the honor and urging continued pursuit of justice and prevention of fascism."
so certain movies that try to be romantic end up horrifying when you think about them for example remaking my super ex girlfriend as straight horror would be one of the few novel and terrifying ways to do an evil superman story similarly passengers was panned for trying to romanticize obsessive stalking was going to originally ask what movie should be remade as straight horror but then decided to broaden my terms what movie do you think would be good if they changed the genre,"Some movies that attempt to be romantic can be horrifying when considering certain aspects of them, like the remaking of My Super Ex-Girlfriend into a straight horror depicting an evil Superman story or Passengers romanticizing obsessive stalking. 

What do you think of when changing the genre of a movie?"
not the let all go to the lobby type of intermission but the roadshow style it not something that can be placed just anywhere in the movie and some do it better than others in way that adds weight to the preceding scene one of my favourite uses of the cut to intermission was in space odyssey and the roadshow director cut of kingdom of heaven,"The roadshow style intermission, when done correctly, adds significance to the previous scene and builds anticipation for what's to come in the second half of the film. One of the most famous examples is in ""Space Odyssey"" and the director's cut of ""Kingdom of Heaven.""  Intermissions are not arbitrary and cannot be inserted just anywhere in a movie."
confused because can find the meaning in his dream at the end of the movie he explains to his wife loretta that he had dream of him and his father in old times riding in snowy valley when his father passed him up his father has blanket around him carrying fire the color of the moon in horn his father passes him up and he says something similar to when get there he ll be there or something the scene takes place at the very end of the film and to me feels out of place,"The main character dreams about him and his father riding in a snowy valley. His father passes him up, enveloped in a blanket carrying the fire resembling the moon's color. At the end of the movie he tells his wife Loretta about the weird dream and its meaning is unclear."
idk if anyone else has thought this but remember seeing her in the nd hunger games movie and thinking wow jenna malone the girl that was in every indie movie saw growing up have not seen her in awhile just looked at her filmography and yeah she was definitely in quite few films but remember thinking hollywood pegged her as the next great young actress and then wondered where she went until hunger games does anyone else feel that way are there any other actors or actresses you can think of that fit this mold does this post make any sense,"You may have noticed Jenna Malone in many indie movies and wondered why you haven't seen her in more recent films. You're not alone in thinking that she was poised to be the next great young actress after her roles in indies, but it wasn't until she was cast in The Hunger Games that she received wider attention."
started watching month ago have watched most of them apart from the wrong turn will watch it later but have to say only liked the first two all the others were terrible was boring didn like the fact that there were no survivors but at least in they fought for their life the victims were pretty much stupid like fell asleep when you were supposed to watch them just finished last resort thought at least toni was gonna make it danny just completely changed couldn stand sally the movie was such waste of plot cause the place was interesting with the historical aspect but nothing happened apart from the killing bloody scenes and the scenes pretty disappointed,"You watched most of the Wrong Turn movies, apart from the latest one. You enjoyed the first two, but the rest were disappointing as there were no survivors, and you felt the victims were stupid as they fell asleep when they were supposed to be vigilant. You also recently watched Last Resort and were disappointed because you felt nothing happened apart from bloody killing scenes."
it cinematic without being overly showy wonderfully acted from the top of the cast down without being full of overt oscar moments an adult story without being gratuitous has stunning score by thomas newman an example of an adaptation that amplifies the best parts of the source material and an ending that stays with you what films do my fellow fans of cinema love that could also fall under the same description of the obvious choice but reveal themselves to be so much more,"You should watch ""The Shawshank Redemption"" starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It is a well-acted and adapted story with a touching ending and a magnificent score by Thomas Newman. It is an example of a film that appeals to fans of cinema who appreciate a deeper meaning."
ive just watched leave the world behind on netflix it reminded me how much enjoy apocalyptic movies not exactly the post apocalyptic movies think that what gets me is the abrupt change happening that leads to post apocalipse there is vibe in those kind of movies that love maybe its the feel of relevant event that radically changes reality even feel like id enjoy living this scenarios as if life would finally make sense anyway what are your favorite movies of this genre ambient,Leave the World Behind is a movie that reminded the user of their love for apocalyptic movies where the world is abruptly changed.

the family stone is very underrated christmas romcom there are multitude of diverse characters each with their own baggage and storyline which one is your favorite and why mine ben stone played by luke wilson he an emotional character with his heart on his sleeve he cannot keep anything in and his comedic timing is spot on thoughts whose yours,"The Family Stone is a underrated Christmas romantic comedy film with many diverse characters, each with their own storyline.

feeling like an ignorant american lately and want to see something from another country that isn just oscar bait drama any recommendations that are wildly entertaining but won make an appearance in the awards cycle the only foreign pictures that get any kind of play in the states are the overwrought character dramas want to see some wacky sci fi some dumb comedy or freaky horror picture something new and different that ve never even heard of,"You should give some movies a try that are from other countries that don't typically get nominated for Oscars and that aren't overdramatic character pictures. Some examples could be sci-fi, comedy, or horror movies that are maybe just from smaller studios and thus haven't gotten as much attention."
it kind of reassuring to know that awful christmas movies have always been around whether they were getting pumped out by paramount or netflix but this movie itself is especially hilarious considering the all star cast of ben affleck james gandolfini christina applegate and katherine hara it hard to say if the acting is bad as the plot is happening at light speed ben character drew is planning for christmas and ends up staying with family and they jam movies worth of plot lines into it there marital problems despite there being no real indication of so the sister shows up and never at all interacts with the brother and then the ex girlfriend and her family have their own issues the list goes on from the home design technology and the gags this movie is perfect time capsule of the mid but with none of the sentimental feelings,"Despite having a great cast, this Christmas movie speeds through multiple plots lines, failing to develop any meaningful characters. Rather than sentimentality, it evokes laughter with its terrible acting and absurdity, making it a perfect representation of bad movies from the mid-2000s."
just watched the captain which is currently on prime video it an incredibly dark true story from the waning days of ww about young private who deserts the nazi lines and finds an abandoned captain uniform his newfound rank drives him mad with power and he builds band of followers who punish enemies of the reich it an extremely well made film and if you re ww or history buff you should give it watch it quite violent and disturbing probably put the kids to bed before this one anyone watch it what did you think,"The Captain is an extremely dark true story about a private who deserts the Nazi's during WW2 and finds an abandoned captain's uniform which drives him mad with power, it is well made and if you are a WW2 or history buff you should give it a watch. It is quite violent and disturbing."

love the original jp and have felt like every film after was an increasingly poor follow up but was when saw the original and not the savvyest film critic this many years later it impossible for me to be objective about the original jp does anyone have any complaints about the film especially interested in ways the movie changed elements from the book that might have led to weaker film,"The poster is wondering if they are objectively able to appreciate the original Jurassic Park film, considering it is one of their favorite films of all time and they may have overlooked some of its flaws in favor of nostalgia. They are looking to hear criticisms of the film to gain more perspective. 

Would you like to critique this movie? Are there any specific elements of the movie adaptation you think could've been done better or differently? Feel free to share any criticisms or praises of the film, considering the poster is specifically asking for opinions on the changes from the book and potential flaws."
for me the first thing that comes to mind is the car crash in whiplash was talking to friend and was only half paying attention and just few frames before it happened looked back over for whatever reason that shit came out of nowhere to me and remember yelling out holy shit think right after that my dad came down and told me to be quiet since this was while ago,The friend was talking to their dad who told them to be quiet after they exclaimed 'holy shit' when they were surprised by a car crash in the film 'Whiplash' that happened out of nowhere.

The ideas include: a breakdancing themed interpretation of the resurrection and ascension, a buddy cop flick following Jesus and his unconventional sidekick Mohammed, a revenge tale entitled ""Jesus II: Resurrection Day,"" an action film where Jesus assumes the identity of a blue collar plumber nicknamed Mad Jesus, and a horror movie about a plague originating from Jesus' resurrection that leaves the faithful as the only survivors."
ve always been observed why they re running around in worn out leather shoes slacks waistcoats blazers fingerless gloves etc you think they be wearing sneakers jumpers denim and all the stuff normal people wore on the day to day in the is it suooosed to create noir vibe to gel with the gangster movie kevin watches did wardrobe just raid thrift stores since they be burning all the clothes anyways is there any known reason for them to be dressed like that,You often see characters in Gangster Movies wearing clothing that is particularly worn out and torn. Why do movie makers tend to dress actors in this style? Is it to give a 'Noir' vibe or is there another reason?
holy shit russell crow was obviously amazing but joaquin was absolutely dynamic he had to play believable narcissist who flickered between love of himself desired approval of his father and forbidden love of his sister it was masterclass honestly can believe it took me this long to realize just how ridiculously talented he is ve always respected him but haven seen gladiator since it came out over years ago think he must be at least currently the greatest actor of our generation,You are impressed by Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Gladiator (2000) wherein you believe he convincingly portrayed a narcissist with complicated familial feelings. You think he is currently the greatest actor of his generation.

rosemary baby directed by roman polanski and he wrote the screenplay as well starring mia farrow and john cassavetes with great supporting performance by ruth gordon for which she won the oscar for best supporting actress have seen this movie quite few times but decided needed to rewatch it tonight my question is about her husband guy he was in on it from the beginning really wasn he they went to dinner at the castevets apartment and he was talking to roman castevet long time and then the next night he goes back to their apartment on his own without rosemary assuming that when they told him that they would help him get various parts if he did what they asked him to do so basically guy was in on it from the very beginning wasn he that always bugs me imagine your husband just literally allows you to be well you know what saying chilling love the opening credits when you get to see new york in the late it really is masterpiece,"You ask whether Guy, Rosemary's husband, was in on the cult's plan from the beginning. You mention that he went to dinner at the Castevets' apartment alone and that he returned to their apartment the next night without Rosemary. You also mention that he was willing to participate in the cult's plan to help his acting career. You wonder if this was part of the plan and if it bugs you.

what an absolutely fantastic performance by an actor that had no idea had the chops to play such deeply troubled character there is some really great work done by jeff bridges as well as the lead actress don have much else to say was sad to read that he has already passed away and if anybody has other recommendations of good john heard roles let me know he obviously known to the world as kevin mccalister dad but would love to watch some more things from his filmography,"The actor who played Kevin McAllister's dad in Home Alone had a great performance in a movie with troubled characters, and sadly has already passed away. If you have other recommendations for good John Heard roles, let the writer know."
tried watching it in full couple weeks ago but stopped paying attention half way through usually love those types of intellectual conversations in movies but trying to keep up for an hour and half of straight dialogue was too much for me even though have no problem paying attention to much longer boring movies it makes me sad because the atmosphere established in the first minutes was so awesome idk why they did not keep it going andre just rambles on like some schizo rich prick with completely unrelatable stories and does not seem to reciprocate wally questions or enthusiasm into knowing more about his friends life or does he idk could not bear it but really wanted to like this movie tell me why you love it plz,"Although the movie started off great, with an awesome atmosphere and interesting dialogue, it soon became too much to handle. The main character's rambling monologues, which seemingly went on for hours, were uninteresting and barely relatable. Would love a recommendation for a film similar to the start of this one."
believe ive seen it somewhere on screen movies or tv dramas probably slow paced home scene where the wife or girlfriend comes back after long day or party and talks to her significant other while removing her fake eyelashes before she goes to bed know ive seen it somewhere but not in real life but cant find any leads if just google it would assume such scene comes up as often as one where the person removes their contact lenses before going to bed but obviously google search would not show that either any scenes you might recall or have come across recently,"You may have seen a movie or TV show scene where a woman arrives home after a long day or a night out, talks to their partner or reflects on their day, and then removes their false eyelashes before going to bed. These scenes may be slow-paced and intimate, aiming to build mood or character development. 

This is a common scene in media because it is a relatable and mundane activity, and helps build a character's personality through their habits. 

Unfortunately, I cannot find specific examples of such scenes from movies or TV shows offhand, as there are thousands of such productions across the world, and their scenes are constantly changing."
michael caine was at filming so let go with an actor around that age or older choose daniel day lewis pull him out of retirement and have him put in fully serious there will be blood type performance to juxtapose the muppets my gf votes for danny devito as frank reynolds as ebenezer scrooge,"Choose either Daniel Day-Lewis or Danny DeVito to play the role of Ebenezer Scrooge in a film serious adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"", written by Charles Dickens. The film should juxtapose the muppets and have Danny Day-Lewis perform a serious role, similar to his performance in There Will Be Blood.

this applied to hetero couples noticed something and it kinda irks me married couples especially parents never have separate last names it is always the johnsons or the smiths or the anglers noticed it in the new movie family switch especially when the mother said we are walkers walkers never quit like it is just very nuclear traditional family type noticed that lot of times the ex wife and current wife have the same last name the man surname it would be nice if more movies were more flexible with names mothers should have their own last name at least some of the time,"The lack of last name diversity in hetero couples, especially married couples, bothers the narrator. They notice that it is usually the man's last name that is passed on to the children and it bothers them that it doesn't happen otherwise, implying there is gender bias in the surname tradition."
spoilers and not for children if you can get through the first scenes of highly inappropriate kisses borederline phil you re in for treat with the horny french man who nearly rapes the wife and do not forget when they broke into total strangers house in germany and used bed pan for brushing clark teeth this is not humorous it just cringe and bad awkward have not even gotten to the porn tape which has nat rlich made its way into the public because clark did not erase the tape can tell what going to happen before it happens terrible movie,"The movie is unpleasant and awkward, with scenes of borderlining inappropriate kisses, a near rape, and breaking into a stranger's house to use their bedpan as a toothbrush. Things only get worse when a porn tape Clark accidentally records ends up in the wrong hands."
do not think he was necesariily attracted to her although that could be inferred the thing about tony is he wants to protect innocence in this world same reason he says he likes kids cause they are innocent and pure the reason he and elvira break up is because she cannot give him child he might have thought that the kid would give purity to his life or he can be part of something good another reason why he does not detonate the car cause there are kids in there cause he is so fucked up and criminal all he can do is not corrupt the innocence around him sorry for the bad english lol not my first language,"Although it cannot be confirmed that Tony was attracted to Elvira, it is possible to infer that he was. Tony's desire to protect innocence is part of the reason he breaks up with Elvira because she cannot give him a child. Additionally, Tony's desire to preserve innocence is why he doesn't detonate a car full of kids; innocence is the only thing pure in his criminal life."

my examples of this are prometheus crimson peak and the lost world jurassic park all of these are fantastic visually the effects work is great the sets are stunning the cinematography beyond impressive but they re all hollow works outside of that making it feel like shame they re not bad they re not that good or engaging another is jurassic world fallen kingdom which was an awful film though did kinda love it for how bad it was however whoever did the cinematography was giving this awful film looks way too good with some genuinely jaw droppingly spectacular shots what do you guys find,"Some movies look stunning but are lacking in substance.

im rewatching the mad max movies watched for the first time this week and now rewatching fury road noticed that one of the wives has the music box that max gave to the feral child in mad max is there theories that say she could be the daughter of the feral child what do yall think the ties are if any it could just be an homage,"You are watching Mad Max: Fury Road and noticed that one of the wives has a music box that Max gave to the feral child in Mad Max, and you are wondering if there is any theory that she is the daughter of the feral child, and if there are any ties between the two movies. 

Some fans think there might be a connection, but there is no definitive evidence or confirmation from the filmmakers to support this theory. It could indeed just be an homage or a clever easter egg included in the film as a nod to Mad Max fans."

there are some iconic scores from big movies that pop up in other media from time to time sometimes they will be very slightly altered but still easily recognizable the two that ve noticed the most are any other name from american beauty and lux aeterna from requiem for dream what the deal here is it some kind of legal loophole that exists because of contract screw up or copyright issue or is it an intentional contractual situation where the composer only licenses the exclusive rights to the film for few years,"Certain songs and scores are iconic and may be recognizable to many people. These songs may appear in other media occasionally, but there is often a reason that they are not overused. 

Could you explain further about why you think some songs are only used occasionally? Are you interested in music licensing agreements?"

recently rewatched elf for the first time in while obviously due to christmas being upon us and while the movie is still funny something struck me very bluntly buddy would be insufferable if he was real don get me wrong buddy is objectively good person who does what he thinks is best at any given moment but at the same time he has no understanding of boundaries doesn get social cues or manners and has an unhealthy level of energy and excitability in the movie he funny charming protagonist but in real life can easily see myself hating him,"Buddy from Elf is a good person who does what he thinks is best, but he has no understanding of boundaries, social cues, or manners. In the movie, his childlike innocence is charming, but in real life, Buddy's energy and excitability would be difficult to handle. The viewer can imagine hating him if he was an actual person. 
At the same time, Elf is a cute movie portraying a person who is genuinely optimistic and never loses his belief in humanity. Few people in real life would behave the way Buddy the Elf does, while remaining kind and well-meaning."
example margin call is movie really like and there is scene at the end when the bank employees make sales calls to dump their toxic assets that when paul bettany character finally actually does his job after you kind of wonder what exactly his role is throughout the movie and through his very skillful selling you see exactly why he makes the big bucks it an interesting reveal of his skills after almost the entire movie goes by another great example is clint eastwood in unforgiven audience finally sees in the final shootout why he was so notorious and feared after wondering if that person would come out or was even real throughout the movie what are some other similar famous character reveals,"The movie 'Margin Call' features a famous character reveal at the end when the bank employees dump toxic assets.

happy to see it but feel like can describe it as metaphor ai artist vs actual artist the chameleon being the air artists who steals dosent spend any time to making their art becaues it steals details from other art from across the web while actual artist poe take time and work hard to perfect their style even to the point of going through even mental downfalls,"You feel that, unlike real artists who spend time and effort developing their style and perfecting their art, which may involve suffering setbacks and facing mental challenges, AI art is like a chameleon that simply steals ideas and styles from other artists without any originality or personal investment."

the term computer generated imagery cgi is bit misleading fostering the misconception that computer autonomously generates results in reality cgi is meticulously artistic process created by people basic explanation of cgi cgi is akin to sculpting with digital clay in software followed by texturing and animating the asset before heading off to post production for final touches the inconsistency in cgi quality regardless of the year its made stems from myriad of factors including last minute alterations by studio executives unclear visions time constraints for artists and varying skill levels it also worth mentioning not all cgi aims for hyper realism for the curious full workflow breakdown could look something like gathering references sculpting both low and high poly models unwrapping and organizing the low poly model exporting as fbx files importing into texturing software baking details texturing exporting textures creating material node groups applying textures to the model painting weights creating rig naming the bones and joints assigning control mechanisms blocking out keyframes and finally refining motions while tools like mocap scans and photogrammetry aid cetain aspects they represent just fraction of the pie,"The term ""computer-generated imagery"" (CGI) can be misleading, as it suggests that the process is entirely automated, when in fact it is a very manual and artistic process. CGI involves creating 3D assets, texturing them, and bringing them to life through animation and movement, before adding finishing touches in post-production. The varying quality of CGI, despite advancements in technology, can be attributed to human factors such as studio interference, time constraints, and different levels of artist skill. Not all CGI aims for hyper realism, and technological aids like MOCAP and photogrammetry only contribute to part of the process."
watched the movie yesterday and was fun to follow the mistery and everything but feel like the guy obsessed with mazes the dead body priest and the mazes in general is like not leading nowhere just add some more dark atmosphere to it but feel like would be better without it because the plot about the guy kidnapping without knowing and the aunt killing kids was good by itself what you guys think am missing something,You feel that the movie would benefit from adding more darkness to it but you also feel that the plot about a guy kidnapping people without knowing and an aunt who kills kids is good by itself. You are wondering if you are missing something the movie has to offer.
hesitant to call it plot hole because feel like that phrase is overused on the internet that said the entire plot of die hard hinges on these terroirsts holding dulles airport hostage by not allowing any planes to land in theory it sounds disasterous oh no what are they going to do however there bwi and regan airpots that planes could easily have been diverted to the movie makes it seem like they are circling up in the air for hours and if they have hours of fuel they certainly have enough fuel to land at some of the nearby airports some further out that are still en route could even make phx pittsburgh newark etc the terrorists plan holds no real threat editing to add some of you are saying the weather made all the other airports unsable well the terrorists did not know this they were intending to rescue that prisioner and got very lucky that the day the prisioner transfer is happening happens to be during snow storm it still horrible plan,"Some people argue that the plot hole in Die Hard revolves around the fact that planes could have been diverted to other airports when Dulles airport was held hostage. However, others point out that the terrorists weren't aware of the bad weather, which prevented the use of other airports."

am probably the only person the world that actually admires psycho for what it is not to critique the movie but like the idea of taking an old classic movie and updating it for younger audience like it because it attempts to answer the question of how well classic movies stand up with modern audiences to me psycho only underscores how amazing the classic is and if you re going to remake movie we all love is not the most respectful thing to do shot by shot remake anyway love psycho as daring experiment that got me thinking about how cool it would be if two directors were given the same script and were tasked with making their movie at the same time of course the point is that they make their movies completely independent of the other you get these two visions of the exact same written source imagine situation in which both kubrick and spielberg are given script of the shining and asked to adapt the script it an experiment that could give great insight into the movie making process and the creative process wonder whether you guys think this is an interesting idea,"I admire the Psycho remake because it makes me think about how interesting it would be if they did a dual directing experiment where they take 1 script and give it to 2 directors and have them make their own versions of the movie simultaneously.

one that comes to mind is the hobbit battle of five armies when first saw it in the theater something went wrong with the projector and it could only display the film in aspect ratio which resulted in lots of stuff getting cut off on the sides of the screen rather then stop the movie the tech proceeded to mess around with the settings in hope to fix it half the movie was filled with this little mouse cursor flying around the screen opening menus and paying with settings eventually they paused the movie and theater representative came out and apologized for the issues and that whether or not we stayed for the rest of the film each of us would get two free tickets was frustrated on multiple fronts because would not be able to come back to the theater for several days because of my busy schedule and really was looking forward to this quiet solo day out the movie just was not that great and that made the whole thing worse stayed through the entire film but my memories are forever in format lol ve contemplated going back and re watching the film but every time think about it am reminded of the sheer annoyance and frustration felt that day and it just completely puts me off anyone else have any silly reasons for not watching particular movie again,"You wouldn't want to re-watch the Hobbit Battle of the Five Armies because the technical problems that interrupted the movie at your first viewing put you off from watching it again. You were frustrated because the technical problems couldn't be fixed so you had to watch the film with a mouse cursor flying around the screen while the technician tried to fix it. You were also disappointed with the movie itself. Despite getting free tickets to another film due to the problems, you were put off from returning to the theater to watch it."
in the movie it states that the barbie within barbie world is linked to real world barbie that is being played with doesn that imply hundreds of millions of barbie worlds or at the very least millions of barbies that look exactly the same millions of stereotypical barbies that look just like margot robbie thanks,"The movie ""Barbie"" hints at the existence of multiple Barbie dolls and Barbie worlds, which implies millions of dolls that look identical to Margot Robbie, who plays Barbie in the film. This idea might raise questions about the film's plot and the nature of the Barbie universe."
there no way they have not thought of an amazing idea for reunion heck ve had this idea for like years that they should have done another film that takes place decades after another hours where jack has retired aka kicked off the force for alcoholism and lives off disability payments and reggie went completely legit and became private detective that was so successful that he turned it into nationwide franchise and runs stuff at the corporate level then one of his franchisees comes to him for help because the case ends up being about something personal that jack was involved in decades ago and reggie has to try and convince him to come work for him to help ve always thought it would make for good film,"For years, you've had ideas about how there could be a sequel to the film 'Another 48 Hrs.', featuring Jack and Reggie. In your idea, Jack is now an alcoholic living off disability payments after retiring from the force. Reggie is now a private detective who has turned his business into a successful nationwide franchise. In this sequel, a case could reunite the two, investigating something personal from Jack's past that relates to a case one of Reggie's franchisees needs help with."
ve been torn between using reelgood and justwatch to me it like apple maps vs waze one is beautiful modern and joy to use but lots of sporadic data issues and the other has great data but lacks on design and user experience at the surface level both look similar but when you dive in reelgood certainly has countless design improvements especially on mobile that make it light years better in my opinion however ve found countless data issues early in the year started reporting each to reelgood they said they were on it but almost year later and not single one has been resolved so while their support team seemed active perhaps it more for show and their is bureaucracy there that prevents bugs from getting fixed for instance found countless show where data was wrong and in each case was correct on justwatch this one is for the wargames and all the copy is correct but as anyone can see the images all show the wargames movie of course individually not big deal but seems to be systemic through the system and worse than that is they do not seem to have process for correcting the data perhaps it being pulled in from third party that they cannot edit or request edit of speaking of wargames when first searched on both platforms for war games it did not come up on reelgood but did on justwatch discovered firstly the classic is wargames and not wargames but also more importantly that justwatch system is more advance in that it searches for both space and no space automatically this applies to any movie on both systems let them know about the issue but also since has not been resolved believe rg uses algolia which is usually very intelligent so not sure why it not working another systemic issue with rg was for instance searching for tyler perry madea witness protection no correct result on rg comes right up on justwatch on justwatch it brings up the movie correctly and shows the official title is just madea witness protection even though the cover art always has the prefix on rg it again does not have the intelligent realize it should come up even with tyler perry ahead of it and on rg some of his movies have the prefix some do not all seem to show up correctly on jw this again applies to all films tyler perry was just one example all of which let reelgood support know about this issue in april for instance of finally similar movies feature when searching for say black swan on justwatch it has section of movies that are similar movies that are all spot on such as donnie darko mother reqiuem for dream etc for reelgood while it does include few correct ones it also includes some completely wrongs ones like hottub time machine dumb and dumber scary movie again this is just one example noticed similar results on many other shows while someone who watches all the of the black swan type movies but also watch shows in the latter list for fun so understand when it says users who watch this also have watched this but seems jw has once again more intelligence in the backend that factors in what users have watched but also making sure thematically the recommendations are similiar also reported many common movies that when searching came up correctly as movie but often another result with the same name came out and same photo etc but was incorrectly marked as tv show upon checking all the ones reported at least that issue has been resolved thankfully anyhoo not sure if anyone knows anyone at reelgood but love to invest my time into that platform since it such joy to use but as user want to make sure they are actively working on all the data issues especially the systemic ones that get reported in timely fashion and if they cannot for some reason shedding light on that,"You've compared Justwatch and Reelgood, two movie streaming websites. You prefer Reelgood's design, but Justwatch has better data integrity. You've reported issues to Reelgood, but systemic issues remain unresolved after a year. Justwatch has more advanced search functions and more accurate similar movie and show recommendations. 
You are unsure whether Reelgood is actively working to resolve these issues and would like to know more about their data resolution processes."
this post has spoilers for all the movies discussed killers of the flower moon citizen kane goodfellas wolf of wall street knives out the departed and fargo after charles foster kane death citizen kane begins with pre release screening of news on the march the fictional in movie production of the movie plot though not story after the screening is complete the news on the march team decides the facts might be on screen but the story is not quite there release is pushed back week or two and reporter thompson is charged with interviewing the main surviving players in kane life and trying to find what missing from the reel they theorize their missing piece is the meaning of kane last word rosebud and go off into the world to find that missing piece thompson introduces himself to various survivors of kane life or their estate and we see him begin these interviews and then we see the recollections he gathers of course news on the march never finds the answer but citizen kane does and it an answer that can only properly be communicated by watching the movie itself killers of the flower moon is citizen kane backwards and inside out killers puts its own take on news on the march at the end and also keeps secret the interview structure for much of the film we see the pieces gathered and fit together but we don see killers reporters the lawman tom white and his team until later this is arguably incredibly delicate in goodfellas scorsese played with narrator shifts on their first terrible date henry and karen take turns narrating and you can see in their body language but also the camera angles and blocking when the shift happens when henry is the narrator karen is barely of interest at first obstructed entirely behind pesci head until she takes over and finally commands the picture in killers we most clearly get similar thing with john ramsey after ernest recruits him the camera loses interest in ernest you wonder why and then john ramsay starts narrating minutes into the picture it shocking and you naturally not necessarily knowingly and certainly not rather than paying attention but in fact precisely because you re paying attention wonder why this person is talking now in response to which the picture like the oracle in the matrix suggests that you re asking the wrong question what really going to bake your noodle later on is who is he talking to but we are not done yet because john ramsay is louder and more overt than every other instance of the reconstructed recollections of white interview subjects why did he narrate so overtly when others did not it cannot just be about setting up the twist or just sounding better that way so why is his interview louder and clearer you have to earn that too and sure enough we eventually see that ramsay was ultimately emphatic about telling his story to the law you re perhaps not consciously aware of any of this in real time but you subconsciously register your question while enjoying the movie if you laughed little harder at get your pencils than the joke on paper is seemingly worth this is why because you had the question in mind and there was tension vis vis this character version of events that that line released as all great jokes do if you genuinely thought the ending of killers landed just right it because you similarly properly gave yourself over to the movie you see for example how the beginning burial and ending obituary read are the perfect bookends how the movie begins with the osage crying not because their children will speak english but because their children will not know their stories which is prediction that has nothing to do with american english and everything to do with the people who speak it you see how the obituary is the truth of that prediction and the movie itself is an argument that they prediction has thus far come to pass by choice not inevitability and on and on and on from killers you get actually get to so many great movies you can jump to wolf of wall street and see how scorsese has earned plot altering off screen death twice in decade both time perfectly calibrated with genre and story you can then wonder if that function of being true story and watch fargo and then appreciate how mollie burkhart and marge gunderson are both heroes whose heroism is best captured by describing the evil of the injustice they combat rather than their tireless quotidian unapologetic pursuit of justice and certainly rather than their marriage notwithstanding your need to judge the marriage or you can go to the godfather and it ability to squeeze character juice from every inch of every frame including the use or not of subtitles whether in louis restaurant or ernest and mollie bedroom in arguably the best scene of dicaprio career or you can go to knives out and have fun adding to the countless ways st century scorsese and rian johnson have been deftly playing with the same subject matter but with different ideology of film such that it constantly feels like johnson is scorsese for dummies in the best ways possible or departed for how it captures hate and violence in way that is so real it almost dangerous which brings you to taxi driver for the indictments of some segments of the audience or barbie for prieto capturing of scenes that seem simple but are actually the whole complex thing or frankly nearly any direction you want could write forever cause when movie is great it pushes against an illusory limit of film and when movie is all time great it pushes on lot of them covering the most surface area of the limits of the form and thereby overlapping with many great movies and killers really is that fucking good but mostly just watch it and kane in conversation when you have chance once you ve done that check out this interview segment with scorsese which discovered in the course of post killers internet rabbit hole excursion finding every instance possible of scorsese talking kane and he done lot of them he obviously loves the film though you would not need interviews to know that it all over his films but this one for me is really the best companion to killers for two reasons first off it just great to see filmmakers talk reverentially but realistically about classics if you ve watched interviews with scorsese gerwig barry jenkins or bill hader you know what talking about scorsese sees kane greatness not as magic but as life affirming but serious challenge to people who really love movies truly great movies are not just awe inspiring they are work inspiring constantly trying in my own mind to compose shots like that the level to which films should aspire to he explains the second reason the interview is particularly great is because we learn that the first time scorsese saw kane it was on tv and the news on the march sequence was edited out of it scorsese lived with the movie for some time before he saw it in theaters and finally saw it properly one has to wonder if that happenstance experience with kane is part of the origin story for killers inversion it been talked about lot but there was point when scorsese needed to rebuild killers away from the white savior trope it really feels like knowingly or not in some ways trying to meet the challenge of kane over years gave him his answer when he needed it for killers,"The film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is Scorsese's reverse engineering of Citizen Kane. It deconstructs the narrative devices of Orson Welles' classic newspaper drama and puts the elements back together in a different order. Scorsese is asking why some stories endure while others fade away."
why does de niro do redbox movies robert de niro does quite few of these understand why someone like mel gibson does since he probably doesn get much work after his controversies and nicolas cage who had financial problems but de niro still gets roles like joker and in scorsese movies and definitely isn hurting for cash so why does he do them,"You ask why Robert De Niro, an actor who is successful and has ample financial resources, agrees to star in movies for Redbox, which typically offers low-budget films and may imply these movies are of lower quality. You suggest that De Niro could afford to turn down these roles yet still get prominent parts in major films. You also wonder if it might be for similar reasons as other actors who face career difficulties, such as Nicolas Cage's financial issues or Mel Gibson's controversies."
not talking about scene where couple of guys are making business deal on the golf course or steve martin is pretending to play pickup basketball with his daughter in the driveway talking about real competitive sports scenes some of my favorites the exhibition game between the yankees and the hackensack bulls in brewster millions with spike nolan talking shit to the yankees batters the pickup basketball scene in the cable guy with jim carey completely legal boost off jack black for the backboard shattering dunk pretty much any basketball scene from teen wolf it seems that nobody in the movie actually knew how to play basketball which made these scenes even better my personal favorite is where that dude yells shoot it fat boy,Some favorite competitive sports scenes include: an exhibition game between the Yankees and Hackensack Bulls; a pickup basketball scene from The Cable Guy featuring Jim Carrey and Jack Black; and any basketball scene from Teen Wolf.

This tactic has paid off for some of their films, such as Encanto, which is now considered a modern classic despite its middling box office performance. However, Disney's latest release, Wish, has not been as successful. The film was expected to tie together the canon of Disney films under one unifying tale, but it has not been well-received critically or financially. Disney is now at a crossroads, deciding whether to put the film on Disney+ or wait a few months. There are arguments for and against this decision, as well as concerns about the potential profits from merchandise related to the film."

Despite the significant change in the world since the 1980s, the film's exploration of the desire to be loved and human connection is still relevant today. The story, characters, and genuine chemistry between Harry and Sally make this movie an intriguing and satisfying watch."
tl dr bc fourteen is writer director of bunch of quickly produced movies that feel more like he not real person so much as an ai trying to mimic an auteur know that this is probably pretty niche area of expertise but asked google about him and came up very short little background love bad movies watch them all the time there something very special about group of people working together and doing their best and just not quite getting what they envisioned sometimes it funny and sometimes it train wreck but usually have good time so when found movie called bigfoot vs krampus you better believe that jumped right on that but here the thing it did not make any sense not like there were plot holes more like random things were shoved in to the movie like shark piloting star fighter satan being in wheelchair bigfoot baking christmas cookies egyptian gods casually chatting with characters etc and conversations sounded more like they were written by that ai that wrote that batman script from few years ago and then there were the performances this was computer animated movie so it was just voice over work but the voices did not really deliver lines with any emotions or if there were emotions they did not really fit with the dialog that was being said there were even few very obvious adr replacements in the dialog now it was not that was expecting hamlet or anything but it was just really weird then it hit me could the script and the voice overs be completely ai generated do not know the director is named bc fourteen and he got wikipedia page according to his imdb page he writes and directs multiple movies per year and the voice actors that he uses seem to only be in his movies so my question is is bc fourteen an ai or is this some elaborate multi year performance art piece that just went way over my head,"You think Bigfoot vs. Krampus, with its shark piloting star fighters and random insertion of Satan, was written by an AI because the writer-director, BC Fourteen, produces multiple movies yearly and his voice actors only work with him, and you wonder if BC Fourteen is an AI or an elaborate performance art piece. 

I can provide some information on BC Fourteen, but note that I cannot verify or confirm the validity of the information, and also encourage you to do your own research on this person as well. 

BC Fourteen is a writer and director who is known for working on multiple films annually, often of the low-budget variety. Some critics have accused him of using AI to write his scripts due to their lack of depth and coherence, coupled with his quick production pace. However, these are just allegations and have not been proven true. He could be an AI, or he could be a person who produces movies at a fast pace."
personally massive fan of these type movies where you watch story unfold and the ending is something you can even describe where it leaves you either on youtube looking for explanations and interpretations or just in complete shock for hours men midsommar tusk vivarium thinking of ending things just to list couple of examples curious to see if anyone had similar taste and any recommendations,"You enjoy movies that leave you stunned or searching for explanations after the credits roll. Some examples of these types of movies for you are, Midsommar, Tusk, Vivarium, and Thinking of Ending Things. You are looking for more movies with a similar vibe."
recently saw the truman show mentioned in thread about comedies that took dark turn don know if that qualifies for that list but consider the movie philosophical in nature in that it prompts discussion about our world the nature of the ideal life etc would also consider yesterday and pleasantville to fall into the same category not necessarily the funniest movies ever but philosophical while still comedic not always in the mood to dissect my emotions following film but still once year or so think it good for me last year added everything everywhere all at once to this mental list of mine problem is think may have seen all of the best ones already so fellow redditors what do you consider top tier philosophical comedy update there have been many many excellent looking recommendations am taking break for bit to watch couple of these,"The Truman Show is a philosophical comedy that prompts discussion about the nature of the ideal life.

what movies have seen where during the credits instead of crying it just has like smiling like made really happy and feel good or like really inspiring and why did that movie like just make that happy or inspired and to feel in the rest of the word limit don have to answer this but when did watch said movie was it recently or years ago,Certain movies have endings that inspire feelings of happiness and contentment so strongly that viewers leave the theatre with a sense of joy and optimism.
this is the second time watched it and to be honest rewatched it because always remembered this movie having this unexplainable calming cozy and mysterious atmosphere and yes was right it was still here like this movie very much it interesting quiet and even beautiful with good performances would love to hear your opinions and theories about this movie how you interpreted the story and ending one thing got ruined for me tho somehow had no idea it was directed by polanski,"You evoke the experience of watching ""Knife in the Water,"" noting its mysterious, even beautiful, atmosphere. You mention the quality of the performances. You ask for opinions and theories about the film, and also mention that you were unaware it was directed by Roman Polanski."
looking for some insight regarding the above box set read in the comments section that the shining is not the original cut of the film and is missing scenes can anyone confirm and articulate why that would be the shining is my favorite kubrick film and think this is solid collection of his work still missing dr strangelove but would not purchase with botched version of his greatest work,"You are correct that there is a comment stating that the version of The Shining included in the set is not the original cut and is missing scenes. 

Unfortunately, I cannot confirm the accuracy of this comment as I am an AI model and do not have access to the specific version of The Shining referenced in the comment. 

It is important to note that director Stanley Kubrick is renowned for his meticulous approach to editing and crafting his films, and The Shining is no exception. Any alteration or cut to the film's original version would likely be significant and could impact the overall viewing experience and interpretation of the film. 

If you are concerned about the version of The Shining included in the set, I would recommend researching the specific cut of the film that is included and comparing it to the original version. Additionally, you could consider reaching out to the distributor or seller of the set for further clarification and confirmation of the version included. 

Ultimately, whether or not the set is worth purchasing depends on your personal preference and the importance of having the original, uncut version of The Shining for your collection. It may be worth considering other options, such as purchasing the set separately or seeking out a complete collection of Kubrick's films that includes Dr."
rebel moon review thread rotten tomatoes reviews user score critics consensus rebel moon part one child of fire proves zack snyder has not lost his visual flair but eye candy is not enough to offset storyline made up of various sci fi fantasy tropes metacritic reviews reviews variety who shot the film himself stages it on an impressively lavish scale all the cgi sprawl budget of million can buy

for snyder cultists only slashfilm by the end of rebel moon the closing title card of end part one feels more like threat than promise hollywood reporter never met superhero team roundup he didn love

into ai scriptwriting software deadline moon is film that struggles to find its own voice amidst litany of borrowed themes and styles while visually impressive it lacks the coherence and character depth needed to elevate it beyond mere pastiche of its influences snyder fans might find elements to appreciate but for those seeking fresh and engaging sci fi adventure this film may not hit the mark then again this is part one so maybe part two will give the narrative room to breathe the wrap moon part child of fire isn complete film the story will continue and presumably conclude in the next installment so perhaps some of this movie issues will be addressed later on and part will improve with the benefit of hindsight or perhaps it will look worse after the follow up comes out which is equally plausible until then it is simply what it is and that is hugely expensive but uninspired star wars knockoff with some thrilling action sequences and some truly ugly moments that taint the entire thing screenrant with rebel moon snyder is positively bursting with exciting ideas but they lack compelling characters and solid plot to hold them up ign despite great ensemble cast zack snyder

about djimon hounsou drunken tactical genius when the imperium descends upon the veldt in the second part of rebel moon and that anthony hopkins robot will explain why it wearing pair of antlers in the last shots but it also possible these unanswered questions are merely pretext for another snyder cut one that netflix can use to squeeze few more view hours out of movie so insufferable that it should be measured in milliseconds whatever the case it hard to be even morbidly curious let alone excited about any future iterations or installments of franchise so determined to remix million things you ve seen before into one thing you ll wish you never seen at all total film zack snyder never does anything by halves but even by his standards the first part of his long gestating space

motivational speeches sexual violence and charlie hunnam stumbling his way through soon to be infamous irish accent bbc nothing exciting happens there are no challenges to meet no obstacles to overcome no death stars to destroy despite the grandiosity of the film bombastic tone the story turns out to be disappointingly minor presumably because snyder main aim was to introduce the cast and to set the scene for rebel moon part two the scargiver which is due next year part one itself ends up feeling bit pointless inverse moon may come off as blitz of interesting ideas that have yet to be fleshed out in earnest it doesn help that child of fire ends on cliffhanger of sorts effectively demanding follow up the optimists among us and yes the snyder bros too may read this first installment as an overture its many loose threads more like breadcrumb trail for future installments to circle back to it ironic to expect more from director that already synonymous with maximalism beneath all its spectacle though the rebel moon universe could do with bit more context polygon bummer to have to dunk so hard on brand new piece of fantasy nerddom delivered just in time for the holidays but try as he might snyder just can match the archetypal sincerity nor the outlandish imagination of the films he trying to emulate here child of fire may not be his worst film but it certainly his least

That being said, this is part one of a two-part story, so perhaps the sequel will give the narrative room to breathe."
so just got done watching leave the world behind on netflix it by sam esmail and like mr robot the one thing know him from it gloomy oddly framed and kinda slow if you wanna watch this movie but better check out it comes at night but it got me thinking last years white noise do not look up before that the midnight sky and bird box netflix is doing yearly the world is ending movie around christmas big budget well known directors lots of great actors the results not that great coincidence or is this trend that will continue is the exception unless you want to count underground as an apocalyptic catastrophy,"Leave the World Behind is a recent Netflix film starring Ben Affleck and Julia Roberts that is gloomy, oddly framed, and slow-paced. Considering that Netflix has been releasing end-of-the-world movies around Christmas for the past few years, including White Noise, The Midnight Sky and Bird Box, with big budgets and notable directors and actors, but mediocre results, I wonder if this trend will continue or if it will die out."
had seen this movie before something years ago and remember liking it decided to re watch it last night and was shocked at how funny it was and the flawless comedic timing of the movie which had not picked up on before what the director does is he will set up characters or plotlines that seem to be propped up to become big things in the narrative and then unceremoniously finish them off abruptly in hilarious fashion here few of my favorite examples the ninja team at the start of the movie they feel like real characters their comradery and loyalty only to get absolutely slaughtered in couple of scenes the bee guy who had the power to control bees to attack people only to accidentally fall into water which leads to the bees perforating his body to death as they try to escape the water the blind sword expert guy who says if you want to defeat me you have to be completely silent but he actually gets killed by mistaking his rival sword with another sword stuck on tree at the end the bad guy of the movie makes an impassionate speech about his plan and vision for the country but when he later hears the explosion and knows the ship is about to sink with all the gold he just sits there for moment completely emotionless and just says tell my people to abandon ship will call them again someday it really caught me off guard how damn funny this movie is with all these crazy larger than life villains meeting brutal and unexpectedly quick deaths,"The movie's director has a knack for setting up characters and plotlines only to abruptly and comically finish them off. Examples include a team of ninjas, a guy who controls bees, and a blind sword expert, all of whom meet comical and brutal deaths. The film's antagonist, despite making grand plans, remains unemotional when these plans are thwarted, such as when he nonchalantly orders his people to abandon a sinking ship carrying stolen gold. The movie has a surprising amount of humor derived from these absurd scenarios and exaggerated characters."
hey folks just rewatched fight club and cannot help it for me there is no more iconic song than where is my mind so give me all your best songs which are as iconic as that wish there are more songs which achieved such iconic status btw please exclude led zeppelin guns roses songs marvel and so on think you re smart enough to see the huge difference between such examples and real iconic ones best regards,"Hey folks, I just rewatched Fight Club and I think the song ""Where is My Mind"" from the soundtrack is incredibly iconic. I'm looking for other songs that achieved a similar iconic status. Please exclude songs from Led Zeppelin, Guns N' Roses, and other obvious examples, and give me some real iconic songs. 

Thank you! 

Iconic song meanings and rankings mean a lot to you, and you're looking for more songs like ""Where is My Mind"" by Pixies (a song with ambiguous lyrics that people interpret in many ways). 

You exclude mainstream artists like Led Zeppelin and Guns N' Roses and ask for lesser-known iconic songs."
kubrick war movie paths of glory antagonist is general mireau who tries to get men killed after the failed taking of an ant hill to deflect the blame for his poor leadership and attempts to shoot on his own men he is vile character with no regard for his soldier lives and only cares for his reputation and political power he does not hide himself well in this film coming off as almost cartoonishly evil but still realistic but the other person in the film general broulard is the second antagonist and seen as the better of the two but think he is worse than even mireau he first tells mireau to lead his men to take the ant hill as he thinks he is the man for the job when mireau explains his division is in no condition to do this broulard deviously suggests that mireau may get promotion if the attack succeeds here you see he is fully aware of the casualties of the mission and the failure it may be so he gives the mission to mireau also he is fully aware of how he sees promoting mireau will make him do it this shows he has even less regard for the soldiers lives as he just wants to gain power politically here but instead of mireau he does all this more subtly and in warmer fashion to hide his true intent here he also says later he is aware of the ant hill being impossible to attack this shows even more coldness on his part as he is fully aware the men are innocent he attends the executions apathetically and congratulates mireau before telling him he is releiving him of his command due to him firing on his own troops again him only bringing this up after the men are executed is incredibly cold and he only does this to better his reputation this shows he could ve saved the men but let them die to improve his own image even worse he offers mireau position as general to dax thinking he only defended the men to further himself he is astounded when dax was sincere in doing this and he criticises dax broulard unawareness of what he has done wrong here is frighteningly accurate for many people in his position back then and even now he is completely sadistic with even less care for human life than mireau he is incredibly manipulative manipulating his own friend mireau into doing arguably his dirty work he had clearly planned this all out before asking mireau to take the ant hill does anyone agree,"In the war movie Paths of Glory, the main antagonist is General Mireau, who is trying to get men killed to save his reputation and increase his political power. Meanwhile, General Broulard, although initially seen as the more sympathetic general, is also trying to save face and is ultimately responsible for sending Mireau and his men on a suicide mission. He is manipulative and cares little for the lives of his soldiers."
so tried to watch little bit of genie new melissa mccartney christmas movie and it based on an old bbc broadcast of bernard and the genie with british legend lenny henry as the genie couldn get very far with it mainly because just found her to be bored most of the time she didn have nearly the same energy as lenny in all fairness that would be hard ask the scene were the genie meets the main protagonist in the original funnily enough both bernard but pronunciation was different is to me one of the best scenes in the whole thing it sets up the genie is from different era immediately it takes longer for bernard to make his first wish of being able to understand him in this version and the comedy of fighting and then trying to figure out what the hell is going on is brilliant alan cumming does so well in this but the new one it kinda over very quickly there is not much comedy with it and it just feels like quick update for the genie who was meant to be trapped for two thousand years lenny does some great acting in this scene and you feel terrible for this man who is now completely out of his era who has lost everyone whereas the new one the genie is just kinda like meh whatever about the whole thing also shout out to rowan atkinson being the villain of the piece he has this wonderful line to an older lady who works under him your fired want you out of here in two minutes you disastrously faded old crone in his delicious plummy tone basically all in all think the new one is more focused on family friendly christmas whereas the older one was about how does an adult deal with crap christmas and prefer the old one does anyone have any other films they feel the same about,"The writer tried watching a new movie featuring Melissa McCarthy entitled Genie, but they found it hard to finish mainly because it was boring and lacked the energy of the original BBC broadcast of Bernard and the Genie featuring Lenny Henry. The scene in which the genie is introduced is a favorite of the writer, who prefers the original over the new version which they deem as more family-friendly and less focused on how an adult would deal with the hardships of Christmas."
personally really liked this movie but it seemed like lot of people did not share my opinion my question is why did people have such an issue with it thought it was well done and the adventure aspect of it made me want more do you think there will be second one would love to know what you guys think and help me understand the hate for this movie,"You ask why people hated a movie that you personally liked. You are wondering if there will be a second installment to the movie as you enjoyed the adventure aspect of it, and are looking for perspectives on why others did not share your opinion of the film."
think the best thing about the amazing spider man movies is the chemistry between andrew garfield and emma stone being couple in real life their interactions are so believable and endearing that would say it is the best romance have ever seen in not just comic book movies but action movies in general their insane chemistry makes gwen death in the second movie so much more impactful than say rachel death in the dark knight another notable romance that really love is between daniel craig and eva green in casino royale vesper is one of the very few well written bond girls and is not just disposable character that bond sleeps with this is part of what makes casino royale my favourite bond movie what are some other great romances outside the romance drama comedy genre,"The most enjoyable aspect of the first couple of The Amazing Spider-Man movies was the on-screen romance between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, who were dating in real life. Their chemistry contributes to the intensity of certain scenes, like Gwen's death in the second movie. Another memorable movie romance is the one between Daniel Craig's James Bond and Eva Green's Vesper in Casino Royale, owing to how well-written and impactful Vesper's character is."
in films like cowboys aliens battleship etc the film always reveals that this is actually an alien scout party and not the full force and all they gotta do is defeat them and then problem solved but imagine you send scouting party and they never turn up again are you gonna be like oh well we tried or are you gonna round up every single one of your boys and investigate mean aliens already achieved interstellar flight so it really just time thing unless they re weird like the ones in cowboys aliens and they want gold just find it so ridiculous it happy ever after they defeat them,"Sending scout parties before a full invasion force could be problematic if the scouts never return. Would the alien species assume the planet was too dangerous and not worth a full invasion, or would they send an investigative party of their own to find out what happened? Unless the aliens are inherently lazy or greedy (as seen in Cowboys vs. Aliens), it would make more sense for them to do the later."
howdy currently intrigued by metacinema and looking for movies that specifically are about actors acting and finding their process for role two recent examples are clouds of sils of maria and may december both feature characters who are actors preparing for roles and working out how to inhabit their characters do you happen to know of other films like this merci in advance,"You are interested in watching movies that explore the topic of metacinema, which refers to the self-reflection and examination of the film medium itself. Two examples you've seen are ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" and ""May December,"" both of which feature actors preparing for roles and exploring character development. You are looking for other films that delve into this meta aspect and actively investigate the actor's process."
they say we must not judge book by its cover and the same applies to the movie poster say but sometimes movie poster can give the wrong impression either accidental or on purpose an iconic example is the poster of scream picturing drew barrymore character at the front with all the other characters including the main character behind her most of us know that poor casey becker does not survive the opening scene,"It is a common belief that we should not judge a book by its cover, and the same goes for movie posters. However, movie posters can sometimes misrepresent the film in order to attract an audience. For example, the poster for the movie Scream made it seem like Drew Barrymore's character was the main character, whereas in fact her character dies early on in the film."
saw this movie was just added to my netflix with ben stiller as the main character did they make another version of it remember watching it on the plane few years ago and it was definitely steve carrell even remember thinking it was cool that he was getting some interesting roles after leaving the office know would not confuse him with ben stiller since was also very aware of who ben stiller is and think they have very different acting styles am going crazy is there another version of this movie blip in the matrix,"You are wondering if there is another movie on Netflix with Ben Stiller as the lead, because you remember taking a flight a few years ago and seeing a movie with Steve Carell in a similar role. You are not confused about the two actors, but are wondering if there was a movie that perhaps had a different cast elsewhere. 

Was it perhaps 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty', which starred Ben Stiller, and maybe there was a different movie with a similar plot that you saw with Steve Carell?"
so ve watched all and been fan of this series for while but ve noticed some things that were not clear so firstly how did calypso become tia dalma what year was the first brethren court guessing early why did bootstrap kill james why did becket not move or order his crew to attack back as the endevour being destroyed could william have had better future if he had chosen to move out of the way where davey threw him instead of lying down there and allowing him to stab him who killed elizabeth father governor swann and why why did ti kwan and his buddies draw their guns when they saw sao fang ship while they were near the poisoned pool how did the kraken die what happened the to missionary who went with serene the mermaid what happened to angelica what was her relation to jack who is jack father is he dead why does he disappear my bad think that it but if anyone knows some of these really appreciate some answers,"You have several questions about the plot of the series Black Sails.

we all know the ll be back and dylan get to the choppah actually maybe just know arnie lines but was watching the conjuring the devil made me do it as part of my rewatch of the entire conjuring universe this movie does not hold candle to the conjuring and the conjuring ii but theres moment where ed and lorraine have just gone through an epic ordeal about two thirds in to the movie and they get phone call asking for help the phone call gets cut off by screeching and ed looks at lorraine and asks what is this thing know it sounds dumb but thought it was awesome up until this point the warrens always seemed to know what they were dealing with but eds uncertainty just made the whole event impact in different way are there other lines like this for people lines that are not remembered or discussed or are from lesser known or watched movies that just made you stop and go whoa,"You may have watched The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It as part of the Conjuring universe marathon and enjoyed a particular moment where Ed and Lorraine Warren call for help only to have Ed ask Lorraine what they are dealing with. It contrasts past moments where the Warrens seemed to know what to do, and you may wonder if you have missed other moments like this line from a less popular movie."
just watched this movie for the first time amazing my one question is this so at the end of the movie keller jackman finds red whistle in the hole he stuck in everyone has been saying that it his daughter whistle that was thrown in there after she was kidnapped and it full circle kinda thing makes sense right however the daughter had already lost her whistle long before she got kidnapped in fact she says at the start of the movie that she lost the whistle days ago so that can possibly be the same whistle that keller found in the hole right please someone have an answer for this or gonna go crazy tl dr how could anna whistle possibly be the same one in the hole at the end of the movie,"You are wondering how the whistle that Keller finds at the end of the movie could possibly be Anna's, when she lost it days before her kidnapping, and therefore could not possibly be the same whistle."
watching the movie and still can figure out something when eva green vesper left dinner with bond to meet with mathis bond suspected that it was trap and chased after her then in the next scene it is revealed that mathis betrayed them what made bond suspect that up to that point we hadn learned anything on screen yet that bond would be suspicious unless missed something bond somehow knew it was trap but have no idea how he knew as it wasn revealed yet that mathis had double crossed them,"You are wondering how James Bond knew that Vesper had to leave the dinner with him to meet with Mathis, suspecting a trap, when nothing in the movie up to that point would suggest that Mathis would betray them. 

Did you miss something in the movie? Typically, Bond's intuition and years of espionage experience save him in situations like this. Or sometimes, the viewer is simply not privy to the reasoning behind Bond's suspicions. 

Did you dislike that Bond never explained his reasoning, or did you enjoy the suspenseful build-up to Mathis' reveal?"
if home alone prequel was made about harry and marv as young men who turn to life of crime would you watch it what would be good plot for that like to think they were good boys and became bad or maybe one was good and met the other one who was already into crimes maybe they were orphans do not know what do you think,"A hypothetical ""Home Alone"" prequel film could center on a young Harry and Marv who turn to a life of crime. The film could explore their backstory and how they became involved in wrongdoing, possibly by introducing elements of hardship and challenging circumstances in their lives as orphans. It would be interesting to see how their paths crossed and how their friendship evolved as one turns to crime, potentially leading to their infamous encounter with Kevin McCallister in the original ""Home Alone"" film. 

Would you watch this movie? What other ideas do you have for a ""Home Alone"" prequel?"
to the people who also watch stuff on netflix im from germany and dont really watch lots of netflix originals since theyre mostly ass but my question is in your own synchronized language whatever it is is there variation in voice actors for you because at least the german dub of most netflix shows literally uses like voice actors for every original there is is it that way for people who watch the french versions or danish versions for example or is there more diversity,"People from different countries can watch Netflix shows in their native language, and the voice actors can vary. Netflix often hires different actors for different languages to perform the same show."
we all recognize ellen ripley from alien sarah connor from terminator and rita vrataski the angel of verdun from edge of tomorrow as some of the strongest female characters in film history but in my opinion elizabeth turner swann from pirates of the caribbean gets overlooked here some examples rotten tomatoes article ranking fearless women movie heroes who inspire us fails to include elizabeth the subheading for the article no challenge is too great for these strong hilarious and formidably intelligent women of the movies describes keira knightley character to tee funny enough they actually list different elizabeth played by knightley elizabeth bennet from pride prejudice buzzfeed article askreddit thread with nearly comments and only few mentions of elizabeth had to scroll for quite some time before finding her am missing something with this character she intelligent resourceful strong brave cunning very funny and very beautiful and without her and without keira awesome performance pirates of the caribbean is not nearly as enjoyable or deep also loved keira is king arthur elizabeth swann keira knightley pirates of the caribbean seems to be an underappreciated strong female character why is that,"You are correct in that Elizabeth Turner Swann from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is a very strong female character who seems to be overlooked compared to other female characters in film. She embodies many traits associated with strong characters: intelligence, resourcefulness, bravery, cunning, and humor. She drives the plot of the Pirates of the Caribbean story forward significantly, and without her, the story would not be as enjoyable. 

Why she is overlooked is hard to say. Perhaps it is due to the success of the male protagonist, Jack Sparrow, or the action-heavy focus of the franchise. Either way, Elizabeth Turner Swann is a strong female character who deserves more recognition."
for example it may start as lighthearted slapstick comedy until one thing goes wrong after another and in the end we have people actually dying or world war or some kind of extinction level event let say we have friends who like to have fun and goof around with regular goals and regular lives until one of them does something like accidentally cross the wrong person or kill someone or the main cast is oblivious to the gradual change in their environment like virus breakout or serial killer running loose another one would be film that after being comedy for most of its length turns very dark such as group of friends ending up in war and experiencing the horrors of it completely played straight just to clarify do not mean movie that is already set to become dark but rather movie that was marketed as comedy that took an unexpected or slightly foreshadowed dark turn any recommendations,"You are looking for movie recommendations for when comedy slowly transitions into a dark genre, potentially including elements like accidental murder, unforeseen disasters, or horror themes like a virus breakout or a serial killer. The comedy should build up gradually into a darker plot twist, contrasting its initial lightheartedness with more serious and dramatic themes."
watched minari last night and it was such good movie the acting and score were especially impressive struggling to understand the significance of paul within the story although really enjoyed him as character in his introduction it seemed like they were foreshadowing that he would cause the family harm he was korean war veteran and jesus freak whereas david had thanked the banker for giving him lollipop he was lost for words when he met paul and seemed nervous around him he made jacob pretty uncomfortable too eventually david came to like paul as shown from how excited he was on the church bus when he saw paul carrying the cross that was before he saw the other kids on the bus flip paul off seeing how sad david got was heartbreaking paul sticks around throughout the movie he performs an exorcism on the yi house after spending dinner with them and is around at the end when they re finding new spot for the well is there any significance to paul other than the fact he an interesting side character the character was so interesting to me and there not much conversation around paul from minari on the internet,"You enjoyed the movie Minari, especially the actor who played Paul. You are wondering what the significance of Paul's character is and whether there is any conversation online about his role in the story."

tv movies direct to dvd movies streaming movies what have you any movie that never got theatrical release the type of shitty shovel ware movies you see browsing tubi or the free section of amazon prime or something are there any of them are are way better than they have any right to be my answer off the top of my head is the lion king,"Sometimes movies that get direct-to-DVD or streaming releases can be just as good, if not better, than movies that get wide theatrical releases.  An example of this is the lion king which received a surprisingly good adaptation in the form of a live-action remake."

watched true lies last week in and god damn what great movie never realized how it was half movie about preventing generic terrorist from detonating thermonuclear warhead and the other half about his family the title finally made sense to me the comedy and action and pacing were all then watched the abyss in the newly released format with the wife and she loved it the alien thing definitely didn hold up also the version watched didn have that scene where the aliens showed them threatening tidal waves which was surprise but yeah same story awesome movie really wonder what great movies we could have gotten out of cameron if he wasn obsessed with pocahontas aliens he an amazing film maker makes you wonder what if,"You should watch True Lies and The Abyss if you enjoy movies that combine comedy, action, and family dynamics with preventing terrorist attacks and alien encounters. James Cameron is an amazing filmmaker, but he could have made even better movies if he didn't get sidetracked with projects like Pocahontas and aliens."
watched muppets christmas carol as part of my christmas marathon still holds up extremely well not only the best adaptation of the tale but also probably the best muppet movie in general what think love about it the most apart from everything else about it is michael caines performance as scrooge he takes the material extremely seriously usually when human characters are in the muppet movies they always seem to exaggerate and act cartoony much like the muppets themselves but caine takes the material seriously and treats it like any other adaptation of the beloved tale and feel playing it straight actually works in the films favor and shows that the muppets crew and henson productions also take this material tale seriously not too mention his transformation from the greedy selfish recluse into more humble and better man is very believable due to caines stellar performance so yeah solid christmas film and solid muppet entry,"Muppet's Christmas Carol is the best adaptation of the tale and also one of the best Muppet movies ever. What makes it stand out is Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge, as he takes the material seriously and does not over-exaggerate his role, unlike other human characters in Muppet movies. His transformation is also believable as he goes from being greedy to humble."
it been over years since saw the movie but just remembered about it the ending never sat right with me and has been bugging me ever since saw it the movie is about group of kids who make time machine with one of their dad blueprints and an xbox the main guy is called david and he finds camera in his attic showing he traveled back in time to his seventh birthday party in the end david goes back in time years to his th birthday party and tells his dad to say goodbye to his younger self he then burns the blueprints and evidence about the time machine and disappears from existence the timeline reboots to him and his sister in the attic finding two cameras here what does not make sense to me how can their be two cameras in the attic if future david got erased from the timeline and burned the information on how to make the time machine if it was already gonna happen should not their be hundreds of cameras in the attic from all the other timelines please explain the ending to me because it does not make sense to me,"You are questioning the ending of a movie where a group of kids build a time machine using their father's blueprints and an Xbox. The main character, David, travels back in time to his 7th birthday and burns the blueprints, causing himself to be erased from the timeline. You are confused about how there could be two cameras in the attic if the timeline was rebooted, and there should have been many more cameras due to the time travel occurring repeatedly."
when saw oldboy the south korean version my immediate reaction was what the hell was that it felt like nightmare the whole movie going from one strange situation to another sort of laughed it off uncomfortably and thought would forget it because it was just so comically extreme sort of like itchy scratchy show on simpsons very violent to the point they re funny but otherwise forgettable was wrong during the next few weeks one particular scene the tongue cutting scene stayed with me and could not stop thinking about it was there scene or movie that stayed with you and kept intruding into your consciousness long after you had seen it,"The South Korean movie Oldboy left a disturbing impression on the viewer, who found the comedy and violence so extreme that they initially thought they would forget it. However, a scene in which a character has their tongue cut out was so visceral that they couldn't stop thinking about it long after viewing the film."
looking for movies that follow specific event that happened in real life but is not biopic like oppenheimer but can still have specific focus on following real life character through said event like captain phillips would like the whole event to be in the movie from start to finish here some examples ve watched recently and have lead to me to post this seeking more captain phillips deepwater horizon patriots day sully to paris world trade center black hawk down siege of jadotville jarhead hotel rwanda titanic elephant thirteen days know and sully can be kind of biopic but their whole life at least from cinematic stand point revolves around one famous event they were in also war movies generally do not consider counting but jadotville and black hawk down are about singular military interventions and the films do not really care about the whole war besides the minimum needed to give context so say its start to finish film because the audience is not really expected to see know about the outcome of the overall conflict after the credits jarhead covers literally the whole gulf war so it counts most war movies like hacksaw ridge will not count because think they re very much apart of large historical event ww that we do not see start to finish while something like thirteen days does count because its more of historical event and the cold war is what can be called decades long period of time not really an event also be curious what this genre is called or what singular historical events you re surprised has not been movie yet,"You are looking for movies that follow a specific event in real life and focus on following a real-life character or characters through that event, preferably from start to finish. You have recently watched Captain Phillips, Deepwater Horizon, Patriots Day, Sully, to Paris, World Trade Center, Black Hawk Down, Siege of Jadotville, Jarhead, Hotel Rwanda and Titanic, and are seeking more movies in a similar vein. You would like to know what genre this type of movie is classified under and what other singular historical events could make for good movie subjects."
or related to song thinking in the vein of jennifer body where the song is clearly at least form of inspiration for the film just saw saltburn and murder on the dancefloor by sophie ellis bextor may or may not have been part of the creation of the movie but it seems so central and relevant to the themes of the movie so it made me think of this question xo,"A viewer recently watched the film Saltburn and enjoyed Sophie Ellis Bextor's song Murder on the Dancefloor, speculating that the song may have been an inspiration for the film. The song seems to tie into the film's themes well."
movie that makes me think of this topic is the bye bye man from there scene where it filmed looking at the reflection of metal kettle or something like that truly baffling decision but guess memorable haha anyways curious if you have weird camera shot you can think of that stays with you like that,"The Bye Bye Man is a movie notable for a strange camera shot where the camera views the reflection in a metal kettle, creating an unnerving and memorable scene."
this rewatch came after plus years of not watching the film but seeing lot of memes so not sure if recall correctly that pacha and kuzco have been shipped would not be surprised too many crazy ships the thing is pacha was definitely more fatherly from my perspective what do you think if you have any good youtube analysis recommendations pls put them in the comments love watching video essays after finish movie,"You should check out YouTube video essays about shipping Pacha and Kuzco from The Emperor's New Groove.

recently bought the bfi werner heroz set and was wondering where should start have seen two of herog films rescue dawn and grizzly man so guess it not me starting but could not figure out the right phrasing for the thread title this set looks to be really awesome but am not sure if should just start with disc or start with the best films in the set to get me in the right mind frame for the lesser known ones know that this is the movies subreddit and am referring to blu ray release but am asking about the films in the set thank you to anyone who replies to this thread can not tell you how much appreciate any help,"I just bought BFI's Werner Herzog set and I'm not sure where to start as I've only seen Rescue Dawn and Grizzly Man, and would like to know if I should start with the best films to get me in the right mood for the others, or just start from the first film in the set. 

I'm asking about the blu-ray disc releases.  Thank you for your help. 

I'm very excited to delve into this set!"
most insane moment has to be area scene where we can spot on screen no less than jessica chastain mark strong chris pratt joel edgerton jason clarke callan mulvey mike colter frank grillo and fares fares the rest of the movie also features kyle chandler edgar ramirez scott adkins jeremy strong reda kateb john barrowman malcolm merlyn from arrow james gandolfini tony soprano and stephen dillane stannis himself crazy shit,"The climax of the movie, which features a large cast including Jessica Chastain, Chris Pratt, Joel Edgerton, Jason Clarke, and many others, is described as insane and crazy. The movie also features several well-known actors in smaller roles, such as Malcolm Merlyn from Arrow and James Gandolfini."
know there has probably been post about this specific scene from the green mile before but wanted to share my own thoughts on it this one scene has to be one of the most horrific and disturbing scenes have ever seen in cinema and it not even horror movie what really cements the disturbing aspect is that it is something that has happened plethora of times before botched executions were probably common especially for colored people and those accused of horrible crimes read somewhere that delacroix execution was based on real life event however have no idea how true that accusation is it also allows the audience to see percy for what he is spineless coward was he truly evil personally think not what do believe is that his actions were evil and he did not realize what true evil was until he stared at del face as it was engulfed in flames you can see the emotions swirling around in his brain through his expression anyways off to have nightmares cya,"The scene where Delacroix is burned alive is disturbing because it portrays a real event that happened often, especially to coloured people and those accused of heinous crimes. This scene shows Percy's character as a weak coward, but whether he is evil is subjective. Percy realizes what true evil is when he watches Del's face melting. 
Percy's expression shows that he is conflicted and experiencing strong emotions. 
The scene is so horrific that it would give someone nightmares."
damnn so much is running through my mind first of ll start this with that movie is brilliant setting is phenomenal so phenomenon that it draws you straight in oklahoma real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal this description on google fooled me read this line and went in the movie thinking earnest will right his ways but movie caught me off guard lily gladstone hats off to her she portrayed the vulnerability the strength the tragedy and the love of mollie so brilliantly through her performance leonardo dicapri leo has been one of my favorite actors for few years now idk but just do not have any adjectives to describe leo tho was waiting for that hitting fist angry leo scene and we got that he was as good as ever ll touch on earnest questioning scene later on robert de nero master of his craft as someone who did not know anything about osage muders and ultimately about bill hales his arc did somewhat caught me off guard starting off as happy uncle and from the scene where he talks about indians first to him asking minnie whether everything is alright to as last resort trying to tell earnest that he should not testify despicable and brilliant arc so manipulative and so brilliantly acted additional cast was wonderful especially jesse plemons was like beauty painted by lord lul branden fraser was nice surprise now this is somewhat random thought and question but did anyone of you was siding with earnest when fbi was enquiring him about his participation in murders first inquiry where he drunk and they kept him stood up even tho knew he was murderer was still kinda rooting for him to outsmart the fbi ig that was my bias as leo fan for whatever it worth was drunk and high through second half of movie and think it made experience somewhat better why am making this post because my head is filled with thoughts and want to let them out,"The movie was brilliant and the setting drew the audience in immediately. The main performance by Leonardo DiCaprio was superb, but the actor who played Bill Hale, Robert De Niro, gave a brilliant performance as well. The audience is invited to consider whether they sympathize with the protagonist, Ernest, when the FBI is questioning him irrespective of his obvious guilt. The audience is cautioned, however, that they may simply be exhibiting Leo-bias."
sad scenes in movies can show up in pretty much any type of movie whether they re animated children movies horrors comedies or what have you but what about action movies not talking about stuff like rocky terminator or even mcu movies talking about stuff like skyscraper or battleship the ones where you can safely assume that they were made purely for profit with no passion or artistic vision behind them what have ya got,"Action films, unlike other movie genres, frequently include sad moments that can be emotional and poignant. Despite the fact that these films are sometimes created solely for financial gain, devoid of creativity or vision, sad scenes can still appear in them. These moments add depth and emotion to the story, despite the fact that the main emphasis of action films is typically on thrilling action scenes and high-stakes plots."
am rewatching all twin peaks and had this thought lately it seems that all detectives investigating murders are either depressed drunk crazy super savant geniuses or other kind of issues dale cooper was just nice charming guy he was smart but not genius smart how do get more of this am very tired of the trope with the depressed drunk detectives are there good crime movies where they made the main character interesting without the need of resorting to the basic tricks of drunk crazy etc edit did say movies in the title but am totally fine with tv recommendations too great suggestions so far,"Recently, while rewatching Twin Peaks, the commentator has noticed that in many crime-solving movies and series detectives have some issues like being a drunk, depressed, crazy or a genius. Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks seemed like a nice and charming guy but not a genius. So the commentator would like to know if there are any recommendations for movies or series with a similar vibe to Twin Peaks where detectives are smart and interesting without the need of having issues or being geniuses."
personally remember gladiator to be visually striking film and certainly do not recall anything that aged particularly poorly in the effects so admit find ebert star review to be kinda baffling can anyone explain the flaws or film theory behind what he getting at in this take foolish choice in art direction casts pall over ridley scott gladiator that no swordplay can cut through the film looks muddy fuzzy and indistinct its colors are mud tones at the drab end of the palette and it seems to have been filmed on grim and overcast days this darkness and lack of detail in the long shots helps obscure shabby special effects the colosseum in rome looks like model from computer game and the characters bring no cheer they re bitter vengeful depressed by the end of this long film would have traded any given gladiatorial victory for just one shot of blue skies there are blue skies in the hero dreams of long ago happiness but that proves the point,"Ebert finds the choice of art direction in 'Gladiator' muddy and shabby, and feels that this choice casts a pall over the rest of the film. He cites the colors, which are mostly mud tones, the overcast filming days, and dull long shots which help obscure less-than-ideal special effects. He also takes issue with the colosseum in Rome, which looks like a model from a computer game.  Characters, too, bring no cheer; they're bitter, vengeful, and depressed."
sometimes hear people say that movie is better when they saw it in theaters because it enhanced the experience what is movie you have seen before that you would like to see on big screen or in imax love seeing movies in imax but not enough do it or were not made for the proper experience,Some people prefer to watch movies in theaters because it enhances their experience. Do you have a movie in mind that you wish to see in imax or on the big screen?
as the title mentions looking for movie that came out either late or early that is horror western and the only scene can remember believe was standoff between the main human protagonist and skeleton do not remember much other than that except maybe the skeleton was animated the same way that they animate them in army of darkness watched this on vhs as kid and that about all can recall,"You're looking for a horror western movie from the early or late 80s or 90s where the main character has a standoff with a skeleton, possibly animated in the style of Army of Darkness. You remember seeing this on VHS as a kid."
posted this to the reservoir dogs subreddit but no one responded in the scene where orange meets his real boss holdaway he mentions how joe assigned names to everybody in the team at the end of that scene holdaway mentions the commode story later on when they are in the warehouse with the chalkboard joe assigns the names this is funny because orange told the commode story to the three guys in the bar as kind of job interview or audition and then they admitted him into the team but it seems like orange should not have known the names in the scene where his boss tells him about the commode story one more problem in the scene with the four guys in the car eddie says pink but that supposed to be before they knew their names,"In the movie 'Reservoir Dogs', there is a discrepancy in the order of events regarding the assigning of names to the characters. 

In one scene, Orange (played by Eric Stoltz) tells a joke to three other characters in a bar, as part of an audition to join their team. The team leader, Joe, assigns names to everyone, including Orange. Later, when Orange meets Joe's boss, Holdaway (played by Harvey Keitel), Holdaway mentions the joke and says Joe assigned names after telling the joke. In a separate scene, Eddie (played by Chris Penn) refers to a character named Pink, who is played by Steve Buscemi, but this is supposed to happen before the team names were assigned. 

This discrepancy has no impact on the plot but may indicate a sloppy editing job."

essentially it is revealed halfway through that as boy casper went sledding with his father and got sick years later his father invented machine that could resurrect the dead lazarus he gets wish near the end to be boy for one night it also stars bill pullman as the father of christina ricci who desperately wants to reconnect with the spirit of his dead wife casper lives with three abusive uncles and all he really wants is friend but he has chance to become alive again after having his life cut tragically short the movie is rather funny at times but quite heartbreaking actually watching it now and paused it because was tearing up at specific moments in the film particularly casper telling christina ricci kat about his memories getting sick saw this in theaters at years old and watched the vhs so many times it currently on netflix til the end of the month and the nostalgia just made me break down it truly dark film for kids that don believe ever would get made today due to its thematic elements but think it great film and worthy of watch for the entire family just shame harvey entertainment made extremely crappy direct to video prequels that believe sort of ruined the legacy of this and caused universal to cancel any further theatrical sequels feel like casper doesn really get talked about much today and hope people don forget this one genuine classic that holds up nearly thirty years later edit the score is so beautifully haunting simple piano but hopeful and soothing you really need to hear it the tagline on the poster still remember to this day seeing is believing,"Casper is a heartwarming movie about a young boy who dies and becomes a ghost. He befriends a girl who can see and talk to ghosts and together they tackle the mystery of his death. Certain parts of the movie can be heartbreaking, but it's ultimately a feel-good movie with comedic elements. 

The movie stars Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci and is currently available on Netflix."
ok so just got done watching inferno the film staring tom hanks and while thought it was an enjoyable movie there are definitively some glaring plot holes or just confusing plot lines one thing that am really having trouble with is the character of ignacio apparently the associate of tom hanks in the movie that helped him steal the mask of dante we learn early on that ignacio helped steal the mask with hanks but then went into hiding with the mask when people came looking for him aswell then we realize that ignacio hid the mask in his place of work but hanks and the gang find the mask but ignacio is no where to be found then we never see or hear of him for the rest of the movie this all gets wayy more confusing when we realize the actual players in this whole big game there are the traitors in the who organization there the evil bio terrorists there the chaotic neutral invisible shadow company that helps whoever and originally wanted to help the felicity jones character by kidnapping and using hanks to follow the clues to the puzzle but realized they were double crossed by the evil bio terrorists right away and then there are the who people who actually hired hanks in the first place is this who ignacio is with like hanks was only set up by the shadow company for hire thing after he was drugged and the stealing of the mask happened before that so was he told to steal the mask by who why would who need to steal anything why would ignacio need to go into hiding in the first place were they being chased by the shadow corp before hanks was kidnapped and drugged so confused are there any answers to these questions like did miss something or are these just signs that this movie is deeply flawed,"You are wondering about the plot hole involving Ignacio in the film Inferno starring Tom Hanks. Ignacio helps Tom Hanks steal the mask of Dante, goes into hiding with it, hides it in his workplace, and then disappears from the movie altogether. You question Ignacio's affiliations and motives and wonder if there are answers to your questions or if the film is flawed."
just saw greta version of little women and absolutely loved it loved the period aspect the emotional impact and the happy ish ending it inspired me and made me feel more connected to being woman it made me simultaneously want to hug my daughter tell me sister love her and take up drawing again can anyone recommend anything else like it have lady bird on the list next but want more thanks edited to add it does not have to be period piece that just nice to have,"You should watch Lady Bird! It's similar to Little Women in its emotional impact and celebration of femininity, and is likewise acclaimed for its directing and screenplay. If you're in the mood for more period pieces like Little Women, I could suggest adapting Jane Austen's Emma or Pride and Prejudice. If you're open to movies outside of that genre, I would recommend Disney's Tangled, which is emotionally powerful like Little Women and underscores the importance of female relationships."
ve checked every day on fandango and they still aren up and it opens next friday saw an ad saying that tickets were now available but they aren and confused and this is the only place could think of to ask usually it still shows me if there are no theaters showing the movie near me but it still says that tickets aren for sale yet,"You've checked Fandango every day since you saw an ad for the film's release next Friday, but tickets still aren't available. When you search for theaters near you, it says tickets are not for sale yet. You are confused about the mixed messages."
so loved those movies when they came out so much so that splurged and bought the extended versions when was broke and never bought anything recently rewatched the first movie and have to say the digital effects looked just terrible like really dated it felt like was watching cut scenes from video game at times have they always been this way am just misremembering or is my player tv downgrading them in some fashion keep in mind these are not blu ray discs so maybe that why but still it looked awful and really broke my brain if this is the case has there been any upgrades done to the movies to make them look better thanks edit did not expect the negative responses but that reddit keep in mind still love the movies totally agree they re great for their time just wish did not notice the digital aspects as much as did all practical effects are incredible though,"The user re-watched the first movie of a movie series they love and were disappointed by the digital effects, which looked dated and sometimes even like cut scenes from a video game. They are wondering if it is just their player or TV or if the movies have always looked that way, and also if there have been any upgrades to improve the digital effects. 
The user loves the movies apart from this issue and appreciates the practical effects."
not perfect ll get into that later but damn was it impactful heartbreaking ode to parental devotion and an urgent call for climate action the end we start from plays well as more hopeful version of children of men admittedly that was one of the flaws had with the film as it does not show enough honest depictions of how humanity would actually deal with the end of the world rape murder thieving etc and its more idealistic tone did put me off as manipulative the film can get very repetitive at times when it focuses on just the main character and her baby the supporting characters have no personality and disappear as soon as they re introduced the symbolism connecting motherhood with water got grating bit and did not think the main character had much chemistry with the other characters but everything else they got right they got spectacularly right jodie comer gives the best performance of her career much like reese witherspoon in wild she in every frame of the film and the physical toll on her is immensely portrayed stripped away from the accents and big acting she been known to do it an entirely subtle performance that relies on her body language and her silence to convey what she thinking of what she does in the last minutes will leave you devastated no mince of words here she should win an oscar for this production values especially for an indie are wonderful art direction is realistic cinematography shot on film is gorgeous in its own destructive way sound design is impactful editing does great job conveying the poetry essence of the film yeah not perfect but worth checking out primarily from career best from jodie comer,"Despite its flaws, the film starts from an impactful ode to parental devotion, and urgent call for climate action with themes addressing humanity's reaction to the end of the world. The performance of Jodie Comer is the main highlight, portraying motherhood in a realistic and subtle performance through her body language and silence conveying the physical toll of her character. 
The film's art direction and cinematography is also worth noting, shooting on film with gorgeous cinematography capturing the essence of poetry. 
It's not perfect, but it's worth checking out."
some examples of what mean actors who might have had huge builds consistently playing meek and non threatening characters plus the opposite those who were small and maybe lanky consistently playing intimidating people actors who rarely played their own nationality actors who were cast as parents lot despite having no kids themselves actors who could sing really well almost never playing singers or bad singers actors who are sex symbols consistently playing characters who in universe are dressed down or even unappealing you re welcome to be very specific but curious about what comes up when you think about this it came up when realised that elizabeth debicki despite being tall giant of woman has constantly played women who are under the thumb of someone in power and some even has to spend the whole film trying to fight back against them,"Some actors are frequently typecast in certain roles, such as meek or non-threatening characters, despite not fitting the physical description, or roles contrary to their own nationality, parental status, or musical ability. Conversely, actors who are physically imposing may consistently play intimidating characters. Actresses like Elizabeth Debicki have been typecast in subservient roles despite their stature."
this is what want from hercule poirot movie not the bore fest saw when went to see haunting in venice like kenneth branagh peter ustinov bears no resemblance or personal similarity with the belgian detective but ustinov is witty and has sense of humor and he very engaging never takes himself too seriously which helps the movie has real star cast maggie smith david niven bette davis jack warden george kennedy olivia hussey mia farrow jane birkin and many more they all have their own subplots most importantly being the one about heiress linnet ridgeway lois chiles not great actress but she effective and as glamorous as movie star can be self absorbed rich bitch who steals her best friend fiance and marries him the best friend is mia farrow of course and she cuckoo crazy in this movie following the loving couple everywhere the film shot in egypt is sight to watch before cgi ruined it for us we get to see the river nile in all its full glory,"You may remember the actor Peter Ustinov for his role as Hercule Poirot in the film ""Death on the Nile."" However, compared to other actors who have played the character, he bears no resemblance to the detective. Nevertheless, he is engaging in his performance and plays well alongside a star-studded cast, including Maggie Smith, David Niven, Olivia Hussey, and Mia Farrow. The film is worth watching for its glamorous cast and breathtaking shots of the River Nile in Egypt."
can someone help me out with kristen stewart and dane dehaan spoilers for oppenheimer these two actors seem to have overcome an initial negative opinion due to their early and or poorly received films twilight for stewart and dehaan for valerion and the city of thousand planets like many others find these performances to be terrible however ve seen lot of people mention that both actors have risen from these roles and that people like them lot which baffles me as still think they re both terrible not to just shit on them but to give some context ve seen stewart in several films since twilight into the wild adventureland underwater and feel like those films are good despite her performances rather than because of them with dehaan think he decent in chronicle but ve been really shocked to see people think he good in oppenheimer to me he looks like teenager acting in play pretending to be an adult specifically the scene when he and rdj are talking about the attorney who will help get oppenheimer security clearance removed and he says ouch is just such poor acting imo that it taken me out of the movie both times ve watched it know he not in it much but think he one of the reasons do not like oppenheimer as much as wish did so what wondering is if you could recommend one film from each actor that showcases their ability essentially the if you do not like them in role then you probably just do not like them what would it be,"You should watch 'Underwater' starring Kristen Stewart and 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' starring Dane DeHaan if you want to appreciate these actors' capabilities. Stewart's performance in 'Underwater' is widely regarded as one of her best, and DeHaan's performance in 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is a significant departure from his early work in 'Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.' 

Would you like me to help you with something else regarding film recommendations?"
when many people think of nuclear brinksmanship movies of the they think of movies like the day after threads and special bullitan with maybe testement thrown in but countdown to looking glass has probally flown under the rader in comparison to this in this movie terrorist bombing in saudi arabia that kills the ambassator causes the united states to mount large military operation landing troops on the beachs of saudi arabia russia does not like this and in the end the new soviet back government of oman institutes toll effectly blocking off oil traffic in the middle east without giving away more it builds up to huge ending this movie is done in the form of news broadcasts with some scenes of the reporters outside of the studio sitting in bars or sitting in cars doing reporter things like taking top sec documents it also uses realy politiicans and military figures which heightens the sense of realisim in the movie people who have seen this movie what is your opinon of it and how well do you think it has held up,"Countdown to Looking Glass is a movie that simulates a television broadcast from the year 1983, in which a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia escalates into a potential nuclear war between the United States and Russia. The movie is unique in that it features real political and military figures, adding to its realistic portrayal. The story builds to a tense and dramatic climax, leaving audiences with a sense of the dire consequences of poor diplomatic decision making. 

People who have seen this movie generally appreciate its realistic and unique style, enhanced by the inclusion of actual news footage and interviews with experts. However, some feel that the plot is somewhat dated and predictable, and that the ending is not as strong as it could have been. 

Overall, Countdown to Looking Glass is a noteworthy addition to the genre of nuclear brinksmanship films, offering a unique blend of realism, drama, and political intrigue."

anybody else feel like the third act was really mediocre compared to the first two thought the first two acts were fantastic the first one especially gosling dying was an amazing twist but maybe too early in the film still loved the cooper act though however after the year time jump couldn help but feel disappointed understand the message of father and sons and the consequences of our actions but feel like it could ve been dealt with better feel like if the third act was up to the standard as the first two the film would be phenomenal but the third act drags it down imo overall it still good film what do you think,"The user felt that the third act of the movie was not as good as the first two, and that it did not live up to the standard set by the rest of the film. They felt that the first act in particular was great due to the twist associated with Gosling's character, but felt let down by the ending which dragged down their overall opinion of the film."
given with everything that is going on every single human deserves freedom the united states doesn fight in wars on religion we fight for the freedom of religion that being said the film has represented what deserves to be defended and what is worth fighting for it movie based on real events but with exaggeration it eli version the fight for true freedom,"The film shows what is worth fighting for, namely, freedom. Notably, the freedom to practice any religion peacefully is something the U.S. fights for and defends, as depicted in the film which is based on real events with some dramatic license."
recently saw the voices dark comedy from ryan reynolds shows more range in his role than he has in his entire body of work where feel like generally just plays ryan reynolds with different name are there any other good performances from actors that rarely get to flex their acting muscles,"You should watch The Voices, a dark comedy that stars Ryan Reynolds. He shows a wide range in this film that is unlike any of his other roles, where he usually plays variations of himself. It features other actors who rarely get to show off their talents."
apart from classics like boyz the hood juice new jack city and menace ii society underrated films like poetic justice south central dangerous minds jason lyric and in too deep gems atl baby boy hustle and flow and get rich or die trying what would you consider to be the worst like movies that did not even try to be good or decent the ones that did not even try to make point or be social commentary dead presidents set it off hot boyz paid in full state property and never die alone are probably the worst hood gang movies that could find and wasted hours of my precious time watching what would you consider to be the worst hood gang movies of the and,"Here are a few movies that could be considered the worst hood gang movies:

Dead Presidents - Plotting a heist against a bank holding illegal funds. Set It Off - four friends who plan to rob a bank to escape the hardships of their lives. Hot Boyz - the story revolves around an up-and-coming rapper and the rivalry between two gangs. Paid in Full - the events that occur when two best friends get involved in the drug trade. State Property - A group of friends who are part of a gang in Philadelphia and the trials and tribulations they face. 
Never Die Alone - a drug dealer who is betrayed by his friend seeks revenge. 

These movies received poor reviews and did not make an impact on audiences like other hood movies that attempt to provide social commentary."
marketing is extremely formulaic but there also gu rilla marketing etc what trailers have used the latter or similar means to market their film purely on the television theatre adverts and trailers alone not physical marketing ploys set up in time square etc who was brave and broke the mould blair witch jaws,"Have any movie trailers successfully used guerrilla marketing or similar unconventional advertising methods to market their films and generate buzz without relying on traditional physical marketing strategies? Provide specific examples from television, movie theaters, or other media platforms. Consider the early marketing campaigns for ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Jaws"" as examples of innovative and successful guerrilla marketing approaches."
ll start with two examples ted and the secret life of pets both films turned out to be pretty decent but from marketing standpoint their trailers were exceptional they both showed off the hook of the film very effectively had some great comic moments gags and had repeat value the best thing about both these trailers was how they almost single handed my drummed up hype for the films that was previously low or non existent as popular as seth macfarlane illumination may have been these individual films did not have the positive buzz before their trailers okay so these are my two examples what others can you think of rules only original films no sequels or adaptations,"The trailers for the films ""Ted"" and ""The Secret Life of Pets"" effectively marketed these movies by showcasing their hooks and creating buzz, despite the films themselves being decent rather than stellar. Trailers can significantly impact the success of a movie even if the film itself isn't great, indicating the power of marketing and the importance of a strong trailer."
feel like there quite few films that fall into this space they re not all military or public sector related for example think the most famous is probably office space but prefer the pentagon wars possibly because office space dabbles lot more in the over the hedge space where it about modern life as well as the inanity and or absurdity of its primary setting that not to say have no interest in that as rule it just that the pentagon wars is purer example of what thinking of so uh does anyone have any examples also if you have not seen the pentagon wars you should watch it it on youtube,"You should check out 'The Pentagon Wars'. It's a great example of a movie that satirizes the bureaucracy and absurdity of large organizations, particularly in the public sector. It's a satire, focusing primarily on the Pentagon's procurement process. If you enjoy this type of comedy, you should check out 'Office Space' as well. It's a great illustration of modern life's absurdity and inanity in the workplace."
do you think it underrated just watched this movie for the first time and it hilarious was probably barely like years old when it came out read when it came out in it did not do well and people did not care for it that weird thought it hilarious people do not really talk about it when mentioning sandler films sandler buscemi and brendan were great together and think it would have been cool if adam would have had brendan in one of his other films during the well it is what it is the were great time,"You Should Have Left is a 2021 horror-comedy film starring Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried. It was written by Marc Forster and Jamie Linden, with Linden making his directorial debut. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Kehlmann. The film received a negative response from critics."
reusing music from other movies was one of the classic staples of movie trailers from the up to the early alongside the voiceover however during the mid late the practice seemed to have stagnated before dropping completely nowadays movie trailers use stock music usually from apm bmg production music or warner chappel production music and franchise based movie trailers make new arrangements exclusive to the trailer so what exactly happened here and why did they disappear the last movie trailer can think of that reused movie soundtrack music was drag me to hell which was fully modern movie trailer meaning modern trailers can reuse soundtracks but they just do not,"While movie trailers used to reuse music from other movies alongside a voiceover, this practice has largely disappeared by the mid-late 2000s, with modern trailers using stock music from specific production companies or making new arrangements exclusive to the trailer. 

There may have been several reasons for this shift in practice, including changing audience tastes and expectations, legal considerations, and evolving marketing strategies. 

It is worth noting that while reusing music from other movies may have declined in popularity for movie trailers, it is still prevalent in other forms of media and music compositions, and trailers may still occasionally reuse music as a creative choice or to create a specific tone or appeal."

remember watching that movie and it was an intresting take on robin hood life before he became the outlaw that we all knew and loved remember the ending and thought that it was going to be great lead up to another movie about his life in the forest and getting the band together to fight the evil sherff of nottingham but in the future no sequal was ever made and some years later they ended up rebooting robin hood again this time with joel edgerston in the lead role why did they never make another ridley scott movie with crowe or even trilogy and if they had made trilogy with crowe how good would it have been,"You're talking about the 2010 movie 'Robin Hood' starring Russell Crowe and directed by Ridley Scott. You enjoyed the unique take on Robin Hood's story and were hoping for a sequel about Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men, but unfortunately, one was never made. You're wondering why Scott and Crowe never made a trilogy and whether it would have been successful if they had."
watching city of angels and the first minutes were disorienting the direction and cinematography are superb and yet it beyond saccharine beyond any human grounding in real emotion beyond coked out view of spirituality those first minutes sat stunned unable to make any judgment knew this would either be the best or worst movie ve ever seen in my life and as that feeling refused to leave my soul minute after minute realized it was infact both the best and worst movie had seen in my life at the same time the best worst movie ve ever seen how could movie this detached from every aspect of reality be produced at this level with some of the greatest performances of the most misguided view of human emotion ve ever seen in my life andre braughter died today favorite actor of mine and he plays an angel in this movie and it comes as surreal shock to see him in such role the fact that people took this movie seriously in the has broken any illusion of golden age thinking might had ever held it movie that makes me believe that we deserved those towers to go down that the late were the peak of the american fever dream it was inevitable neo capitalism couldn have gone any farther without rebuke culture had split either you were listening to manson buckley the cranberries and rem watching miramax movies produced by future sexual predator or you were riding the crest of wave of hyper normalization where the satire of your white bread hollow suburban lives was an acceptable joke because you held the power what is this movie and what has it done to my mind there no through line it preposterous emotional drivel with the actors to pull it off and society removed enough from any sort of real strife to gobble it up like negroni something designed to be bitter reminder of reality that those who can afford to consume it have long ago left cultivated as purposeful and carefully designed replication of the horror that those below there station live day in and day out want to applaud the cast and crew that were able to elevated such trash proving once and for all that all the world is indeed stage and if comfortable enough we will believe anything presented on that stage,"The narrator is stunned by the beginning of the movie City of Angels. They feel that the movie is saccharine and lacks grounding in real emotion. They are confused as to how the movie, which portrays a misguided view of human emotion, was produced at such a high level with great performances. The narrator is reminded of the actor Andre Braughter who played an angel in the movie and passed away recently. 
The narrator reflects on the contrast between the audiences who were either watching serious movies or lighthearted hyper-normalization movies, and wonders what purpose the aforementioned movie serves. They applaud the cast and crew for their ability to elevate the trash, but question if this is a problem with society as a whole."
man on fire trying to rewatch this since it streaming and oh my god did not remember the constant zoom in zoom out lense flarey blinding light effects do not even know what reason there would be to put it in the movie it completely destroys the rewatch for me what your unnecessary cinematography movie,"The cinematography in this film is too flashy and distracting with unnecessary zooms, lens flares, and blinding light effects.

what are some fun good examples of movies that had changes made during their production in an attempt to steal copy ideas from movie that had just come out to wide success anything from stealing plot points or adding in scenes maybe changing the title of film or any famous examples of producer bring like what if we made this movie of ours more like what can you think of movies,"Here are some examples of movies that have been influenced by other popular films:

- The Hangover (2009) - This comedy thriller has been noted for taking several plot elements from the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), including the narrative structure and substance abuse themes. 
- Ghostbusters (1984) - The creators of this film drew inspiration from previous comedies, notably Ghostbusters (1981), for the development of its script and concept. 
- Iron Man (2008) - The use of the fictional weapon called the ""Iron Man"" in this superhero film was notably similar to that of ""Iron Man"" in the novel ""Snow Crash"" (1992) and the manga series ""Astro Boy"" (1952-1968). 
It's worth noting that these examples represent instances of creative inspiration and the evolution of cinema, often influenced by various forms of media."
just saw kristin scott thomas in french film had no idea she could speak french fluently and has been doing french films for quite some time now good for her imagine the luxury of not having scripts up to your taste so you jump on train to another country to get scripts that are up to your taste then jump back on train at your pleasure ever since saw him in inception understood ken watanabe had dual successful careers in english and in japanese good for him too saw viggo mortensen did his first spanish film recently language he grew up speaking but had no investment in as career seems to be one off any other actors ve missed,"Kristin Scott Thomas was seen in a French film, proving she can speak the language fluently. Ken Watanabe has built dual careers in Japan and America since Inception. Viggo Mortensen has done a Spanish-language film, albeit with no plans for further Spanish-language roles."
just watched that movie and do not get the point at all the scary music made it seem like there would be big twist nothing happened at all do not understand why the reviews were so positive the plot did not go anywhere the acting seemed wooden can anyone explain why they liked this movie and why todd haynes made it the real story that inspired it is much more compelling,You are disappointed with a movie you just watched as you felt there was no plot and the acting was poor. You are confused why it had good reviews. The real story that inspired it was much more interesting to you.

The summary implies that the situation with mafias in Italy has worsened to the point where it has become unsustainable both domestically and internationally, with people suffering tremendously and even being killed for stupid reasons due to wars between families. The author seemingly calls for anarchy to eradicate the evil in humanity."
was watching the year without santa claus it the one with heat miser and snow miser recently and it occurred to me that would love to see live action remake so started thinking about who would like to see play the different parts like to see james corden as heat miser and hugh jackman as snow miser who would be good to play santa and mrs claus or mother nature,"You are thinking of doing a live action remake of the 1974 Year Without Santa Claus and discussing who would be good for the role of Heat Miser, Snow Miser, Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus, and Mother Nature."
know this is kind of late but like wtf this american man making his whole personality about another country is just cringe asf also he kept saying banditti as if thats what russian people call gangster he was probably referring to the word wich is referring to multiple people and russian people dont even use as word for gangster dont know but this movie was just hard watch,"The character in the movie keeps saying ""banditti"", which is not a word Russian people use to describe gangs. The movie was hard to watch because of that and because the main character seems to base his whole personality on Russia, which comes off as cringe."
recently watched late night showing of the holdovers in theater completely by myself it was amazing no distractions completely immersed on the flipside was lucky enough to watch everything everywhere all at once in packed theatre that loved every joke tons of laughter equally great experience think irrationally love each movie more because of how watched them rather than just the content of the films just curious when you list your favorite movies if you add qualifiers like this or is it normally just based on the film in any setting,"You can have a different viewing experience of a movie depending on whether you watch it in a theater alone or with an audience, and whether that audience is engaged with the film. Your preference might be for solitary viewing or for an engaged audience, but you can also have preferences for particular movies that depend on the setting in which you saw it."
ve noticed in broken lizard films there is almost always tiny little throwaway scene where one of the characters says something along the lines of what sounds like whazzupoopy in high pitched voice specifically can think of the scene in beerfest when the bavarians are spying into schnitzengiggle tavern via submarine and in the slammin salmon when nuts zongo throws his antipsychosis medication at one of his coworkers after refusing to take it pretty certain it in super troopers as well perhaps just in cutaway scene does anyone have any idea what they re saying or why this recurring seemingly nonsensical phrase seems to be in all their movies presumably just an inside joke or lingo that group of friends would use but if anyone knows more about it be interested to know nobody puts zongo in cage,"You've noticed a recurring throwaway line in Broken Lizard's movies, where a character says ""whazzupoopy"" in a high pitched voice, and you're wondering what it means and why it's in their movies. It's possible that it's an inside joke or lingo among the group of friends, but you're interested to know more about it. 
No one knows why this is yet, but it appears in many of their films."

my bets are on margot robbie barbie lily gladstone killers of the flower moon sandra huller anatomy of fall emma stone poor things greta lee past lives natalie portman for may december or carey mulligan for maestro could replace two of these nominees but for me these top are my biggest certainties,"Here are the acting nominations that seem most likely going forward according to user: Margot Robbie (Barbie), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon), Sandra Huller (Anatomy of Fall), Emma Stone (Poor Things), Greta Lee (Past Lives), Natalie Portman (May December) and Carey Mulligan (Maestro).  Two of these nominations may be replaced but these are the top picks."
ve seen many action thriller films which sometimes feature russian characters but most of the time they re always played by either british or swedish actors their performances are not bad though but this has become core staple in the typecasting game take for example john wick viggo is played by swedish actor michael nyqvist and his son iosef is played by brit alfie allen on the other hand have reason to believe this is due to actual russian actors not wishing to be hollywood famous or because of political differences that prevent them from being in such films or because the actors themselves are not bilingual,"British or Swedish actors often play Russian characters in action thriller films, which has led to discussions about typecasting and possible reasons for the lack of Russian actors portrayal of their own nationality in Hollywood. 

One possible reason is that Russian actors don't want to be typecast in these roles and avoid Hollywood fame altogether, while another hypothesis is that political differences discourage Russian actors from collaborating with Hollywood filmmakers. 

It is also possible that Russian actors are not offered these roles simply because they are not bilingual and Hollywood tends to favor actors who can accommodate the global audience with their performance."
the humor even though oppenheimer is primarily drama that does not mean that there are not few moments of levity throughout even though they are pretty far between there are many humorous moments throughout the movie from oppenheimer neglecting to have kitchen installed at his home in los alamos to henry stimson not wanting to drop the bombs on kyoto because that where he and his wife had their honeymoon the film does have few funny moments throughout and what makes them even more amusing is that quite few of them really happened in real life the makeup another minor point but the makeup work in this movie is really good the true standout being lewis strauss the film went to painstaking lengths to make sure that robert downey jr looked like lewis strauss they also made sure that tom conti looked like albert einstein it honestly amazing and would not be surprised if the film gets nomination for best hairstyle and makeup even though probably will not win if it gets nominated the deconstruction at it heart oppenheimer is deconstruction of the great man biopic for those of you not familiar with what talking about great man biopic is pretty much exactly what it sounds like biopic about an extraordinary man who did extraordinary things even though oppenheimer is not portrayed extremely negatively the film does make it pretty clear that at the end of the day he basically pawn of the us government the minute his job is complete the government does not hesitate to wash it hands of him not only that but they take away his security clearance by dredging up every skeleton in oppenheimer closest including being member of the communist party did mention that oppenheimer hearing was happening around the same time as the red scare also unlike most great man biopics where the subject changed the world for the better oppenheimer tells the story of man who created something that could change the world for the worse and that only if it does not outright end the world in other words good luck watching another biopic again after watching oppenheimer the historical accuracy one of the most consistently praised aspects of oppenheimer is it commitment to historical accuracy this is honestly one of the most historically accurate biopics ve ever seen lot of what is depicted in the movie really did happen in real life oppenheimer really did poison an apple harry truman really did call oppenheimer crybaby and lewis strauss really was that petty it honestly amazing how much christopher nolan did his homework before making this movie naturally the film does take quite few liberties for example lewis strauss does not know who john kennedy was despite him having been senator for over decade at that point and having come from one of the most influential american families of the time but overall the film takes the based on true events part very seriously the characters you think that with cast of characters as large as the one in oppenheimer it would be tough for characters to stand out well they do oppenheimer is conflicted man who spends large majority of the movie trying to martyr himself to atone for what he has done his wife kitty loves her husband but is also willing to call him out when he needs it and takes no crap general rhodes is an interesting character who has great chemistry with oppenheimer lewis strauss is the closest thing to villain that the movie has and he fills that role very well to the point where he may be one of the best villains of the year if not the decade so far even the minor characters such as albert einstein david hill niels bohr and other leave lasting impressions the visual effects only christopher nolan could have recreated an atomic explosion without any cgi whatsoever and that just scratching the surface of the visual effects work in this movie despite not being traditional blockbuster oppenheimer boasts some truly impressive special effects but of course the star of the show is the atomic explosion scene so iconic that even people who have not seen the movie at least know of it the score holy shit the score since nolan regular composer hans zimmer was working on dune part during production the task of scoring oppenheimer went to ludwig gorranson who you may know as the composer for black panther and the mandalorian and as much as love hans zimmer gorranson was ultimately the better choice to score this movie because his score to be quite blunt is amazing pretty much every musical track in this movie is beautiful and haunting at the same time which if you think about it is fitting metaphor for the movie itself if gorranson gets nominated for best original score at the oscars the other nominees may as well not even show up the performances it only natural that film full of so many talented actors would be full of amazing performances and this movie most certainly has them this is one of the most well acted movies of cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon florence pugh kenneth branagh gary oldman tom conti rami malek and other actors gives great performances even the actors who play minor roles make meals out of their short screentime if there was category at the academy awards for best cast this movie would almost certainly win the cinematography as this point it should not be any surprise that christopher nolan movie is pretty to look at but this movie is easily one of his most visually impressive films not only are there many beautiful shots of landscapes but this film is the first imax movie to use black and white cinematography and the black and white cinematography looks very good although do not know if it the best looking live action movie of the year it is easily top the themes if may be permitted to do my best stoner impression this movie is like really deep man this film delves into so many deep themes that will leave you thinking long after you ve left the theater scientific discovery vs ethical obligations whether or not progress is always good thing self reflection and inner conflict the complexity of historical figures this is just scratching the surface of the numerous themes of the movie all of these things combined results in movie that is not only the best movie of the year but one of the best movies of the decade so far it may even go down as one of the best movies of the century with this film christopher nolan further proved why he is one of the best filmmakers currently working it amazing how in year that gave us giant monsters multiverse conflict and holiday themed serial killers the best movie of the year is hour biopic about man that most people probably did not even know existed before they heard of the movie but that is the case in my humble opinion christopher nolan oppenheimer is the best movie of,"Despite being a drama, Oppenheimer manages to have several humorous moments throughout. The makeup work in the film is outstanding, with Robert Downey Jr. looking remarkably like Lewis Strauss. The film is a deconstruction of the ""great man biopic"", depicting a man who did extraordinary things for potentially disastrous outcomes. Historically, the film is very accurate, and the characters stand out strongly despite the large cast. The visual effects are impressive, especially the atomic explosion scene. The score is beautifully haunting and fits the mood of the film perfectly. The performances by the large cast of talented actors are phenomenal. The cinematography is stunning, and the film explores deep themes about scientific discovery, ethical obligations, progress, and self-reflection. Oppenheimer is not only the best movie of the year but also one of the best films of the decade."
think this movie is remembered for it lol quirky so random style the hamburger phone and the silly dialog but watching it as an adult it so much more than that it amazing jason bateman was written so ahead of his time throwing down red flag after red flag that totally missed as teen not unlike juno herself guess same for jennifer garner exemplifies how easy it is for female character to be unlikable when she incredibly reasonable and just frustrated at jason bateman inability to grow up allison janney and jk simmons are amazing parents showing how they can disagree with their kids choices sometimes fight but still show up with unconditional love and support the last act of the movie is so beautiful everyone watching was fully crying seriously give juno another watch if you have not seen it in while or watch it for the first time if you have not before,"This movie is much more than silly dialog and quirky style; it exemplifies nuanced, realistic relationships between partners and parents in a way that showcases the struggles of growing up without diminishing the characters' agency and maturity. Give Juno a watch if you want to see great acting and realistic relationships portrayed on screen."
hi this summer watched culpa and was totally obsessed but thing bothered me and wanted to share it with all to see if the only one thinking that way basically the protagonists of the movie nicole and gabriel are friends since they already worked together in the spanish remake of the show skam so the chemistry between them it obvious really they make such great team on screen probably the two even had some relationships idk but found extremely exaggerated the way that the fan ship them like for example when gabriel goes out with some girl the fans especially on twitter starts to saying in total serious way gabriel why did you do that you re such jerk for doing this to nicole you don deserve her and things like that now get it that the way the are together can make think that they are in relationship but we don know that we don know if they are were couple or not and we can decide for them that they must stay together just cause on screen they make great couple they seriously need to understand that character actor so if noah in the movie was in love with nick it doesn mean that nicole must be in love with gabriel in real life know that those type of things happens all the time in romantic movies or in tv shows were there are relationships and it thing that never understood let me know what you know,"The Twitter reaction to the movie Culpa was overly obsessive and exaggerated towards the relationship of the two main characters, Nicole and Gabriel. Fans seemingly shipped them as a couple  in real life, presuming their on-screen chemistry translated to a relationship off-screen. However, the narrative never confirms if they were a couple or not, and fans should allow the actors freedom to explore other relationships off-screen."
the topic of scenes being too on the nose seems to come up on this subreddit fairly often the usual examples are suicide squad zack snyder music choice or the final shot from the departed anyway it got me thinking are there any acceptable scenes when movies have been overly literal or is it something better suited for comic relief,"Sometimes movie scenes can be too literal to the point where it takes you out of the film, but is it something that should always be avoided or can it be done successfully? Discuss examples of when it works and when it doesn't. Provide your opinion on whether it is dependent on the genre of the film."

nearly and still no north american release of director and cowriter vincenzo natali classic cube on blu ray let alone cube was originally released to theaters in canada by cineplex odeon and the us by trimark now owned by lionsgate like so many other inspiring indie sf movies primer transfer hardware pi and more natali work gets talk lots of talk yet only talk it has two unremarkable sequels and japanese remake that that floundered with audiences yet the powerful and heavily influential original cube slides down the memory hole into obscurity why ve no idea still any movie that has this much heat and this much talk over quarter century later and nothing that happens in this movie renders it obsolete today means not the only one who loves it,"Cube, a sci-fi movie directed and cowritten by Vincenzo Natali, is still unavailable on Blu-ray in North America 25 years after its release in Canada and the US. Its lack of availability contrasts with the popularity of Cube, which has spawned two sequels and a Japanese remake, all of which failed to capture the allure of the original. 

Fans speculate about the reasons for Cube's absence from North American Blu-ray releases, but none of these reasons seem to justify its continued obscurity."
highest grossing leading actors with some restrictions must be the lead of movie no ensemble movies exclude superhero and animated and movies lot of these lists include superhero movies and supporting roles that vastly inflate the numbers my question is about actors that bring viewers to the theater just on name alone not including animated movies or superhero movies that relies more on the ip rather than just the actors so who are the biggest box office draw actors in the world right now,"Which actors are the biggest box office draw when removed from the equation animated and superhero movies and when limited to leading roles, no ensemble casts where other actors may be the draw?

what mean is typically in movies they tend to only use about seconds of song not talking about the movie score and there are multiple reasons for that sure including rights cost and characters need to get back to talking but sometimes they ll quiet the song down so we can still hear it under the dialogue or there movies like donnie darko where almost the whole tears for fears song is played because it just cool and for the setting of the film letting us know what time in history it is essentially of course not all movies use music for the setting but what other movies have used the whole song or large portion of it,"Songs in movies are often times truncated to only a portion of the whole song for various reasons relating to cost and to keep the audience focused on what is happening in a scene. However sometimes directors will incorporate longer songs or large portions of them into their films, often to set a certain tone or to establish the time period of the scene. 

Examples of movies that have made use of this technique would include 'Donnie Darko' and 'Almost Famous'."
think liked funny lady lot more than funny girl funny girl just seemed to me that it was another star is born retread and while barbra streisand was good and sang beautifully felt her fanny brice was too weak and too much of pushover funny lady enjoyed seeing stronger and more independent fanny streisand was given more layers to work with and thought james caan was much better male lead than omar shariff whom always found to be mediocre actor riding on his looks funny girl is only better when it came to the songs but as an overall movie much prefer funny lady the grudge is solid horror movie and lot scarier than the first movie thought amber tamblyn was much more effective than sarah michelle gellar and liked the anthology structure,"Although Funny Girl has some good songs, Funny Lady is a better movie because it gives Fanny Brice more depth and portrays her as stronger and more independent. The Grudge 2 is also a solid horror movie and scarier than the first, with a good performance by Amber Tamblyn."
does sylvia know henry identity from the start in the scene where she asks him to bring her glass of milk she points out that he has his hand in his pocket not yet knowing the twist at that point thought she was legitimately correcting his demeanor as servant but in friendly way because she was into him knowing the twist think it plausible that she was giving an actor note plus it just seems that if her husband had agreed to the ruse she would have known too plus she is written and played as smarter and more perceptive than her peers plus it easier to believe that she would want to sleep with an actor than that she would want to sleep with servant even hot one on the other hand on his second visit she seems surprised when his accent slips is she just pretending to be surprised is she giving him another note the movie is full of these kinds of nuances and ambiguities just kind of intrigued by this one,"You are intrigued by the scene in which Sylvia asks Henry to bring her a glass of milk, because it is ambiguous whether she knows Henry's identity or not. On one hand, she seems to be flirting with him, but on the other hand, she seems surprised when he slips up in his accent. You wonder if she is pretending or if she is giving him notes as an actor."
let say there real sequel to american psycho not american psycho where high school teen murders patrick bateman in the opening scene and then it becomes halloween lite slasher what era would have the most parallels with the hedonistic portrayal of the of the original film but is closer to our own time imagine either the peak of the housing bubble in or the peak of the silicon valley bubble in but cannot decide which one would be the best or if there are any better ideas please let me know which time would be best for hypothetical american psycho to be set in,"You ask for input on a potential sequel to American Psycho set in a contemporary era with parallels to the original 1980s hedonistic lifestyle:

The peak of the Silicon Valley bubble (around the 2000s) or the peak of the housing bubble (around the mid-2000s) are two potential time periods that could work for setting a sequel to American Psycho. Both eras showcase opulent lifestyles and extreme materialism, reflecting the hedonism of the 1980s. However, it's also suggested that there may be other periods that could be more suitably contrasted with the present time, providing a more distinct backdrop for a sequel while maintaining similarities to the original film."
bollywood has been relegated to cinema where originality does not exist anymore movies often seem to copy and paste what has worked before instead of trying to work with something new wednesday released in is proof that there is no lack of talent in this country just fear of taking risks the premise is not anything inventive the story revolves around the character credited as the common man naseeruddin shah who has planted bombs in the city of mumbai and is blackmailing the police officer prakash rathod anupam kher to meet his conditions without featuring any sort of big action set pieces the film solely relies on its screenplay to tell its story but with screenplay like this it is no surprise that film has turned out to be this excellent an exceptional monologue about the struggles of the common man is enough to categorize this movie as classic but besides the monologue the film has plenty of thrills to keep you on the edge of the seat it does not help that the monologue was exceptionally delivered by naseeruddin shah was moved by his delivery you could sense that it was extremely personal to the character which is testament to his performance anupam kher is also great as police officer but he is outshone by naseeruddin shah my complaints about the film would be nitpicky but there are some performances of extras that appeared completely devoid of emotions also there is blast scene in the film which came off as cartoonish it would have been better if they employed practical effects instead of using cgi also felt that the film message about terrorists having no religion was kind of missed as the terrorists featured in the film were all muslims,"Wednesday is an great thriller that delivers despite its unoriginal premise. It features a terrific performance by Naseeruddin Shah as a common man turned terrorist who blackmails a police officer Prakash Rathod, played by Anupam Kher. The film's screenplay is it's strongest aspect alongside it's message about the struggles of the common man. My only complaints are some weak performances by extras and some questionable CGI."
at the end of the movie we hear brooks explain that he sold the wit sec list for bunch of money and then double dipped tipping the people off on it for fee then while playing games after what feels like happy ending the camera pans out to vehicle with guys locked and loaded get out of vehicle before it goes to credits the entire cast of friends and family in this movie get wasted the night max and the gang find out annie is pregnant these guys arent there to kidnap brooks they are there to kill him he wouldnt have anything valuable to be taken for its retribution revenge hit for his dealings in the movie presume these hit men at the end belong to some insanely vicious employer that wont leave witnesses behind and will kill everyone brooks is close to as message what an insanely dark ending to fun action comedy,"At the end of the movie we find out Brooks sold the Wit Sec list and then double dipped by tipping off people on it for a fee. Friends and family of Max and the gang get drunk to celebrate Annie's pregnancy. Hit men arrive to kill Brooks as revenge for selling the list, and they kill everyone he is with to send a message.

researching for project and looking for sequences in movies live action or animation in which we see the transition from reality into character imagination this could be for story they are telling fantasy they are day dreaming or memory they are reliving definitely not looking for scenes where the character is dreaming we need to be entering into the character conscious imagination also not looking for scenes where we only realise we were in fantasy once we snap back to reality interested in the moment we transition with the character from the real world to their imaginary world ve got few but there must be loads more so thought ask the reddit hive mind,"I am researching sequences from movies (live action or animation) in which a character transitions from reality to imagination. I am specifically interested in scenes where the viewer consciously enters the character's imagination and experiences their fantasy, day dream or memory along with them. I am looking to explore how this is achieved through filmmaking techniques, excluding scenes where the character is simply dreaming. Do you have any favorite examples of this?"
one thing really love about recognizable celebrities making brief appearances in movies is how they are able to steal the show from the limited amount of screen time they have in the film alone and that is what love about bernie mac cameo as bobby bolivia in transformers he manages to bring so much humour in his one scene where sam and his father are meeting him to purchase one of his cars scene that could easily be forgotten about or is not one of the most memorable scenes he makes it even more iconic with the way he delivers one of the best lines in the movie driver don pick the car car picks the driver it mystical bond between man and machine,"Bernie Mac steals the show in his brief but memorable cameo appearance as Bobby Bolivia in Transformers. His singular scene adds humor to the film and delivers one of the movie's most iconic lines: ""Driver don't pick the car, the car picks the driver."" Mac's performance exemplifies the mystique that can occur when celebrities briefly appear in films."
in social psychology this would be the concept of the superordinate goal as studied experimented by muzafer sharif in his robbers cave experiment not sure what the proper trope is here enemy mine or fire forged friends my examples give the general idea of what after rivals or enemies who co operate for one reason or another common cause or greater good examples war horse two soldiers on opposing sides meet in no man land to free trapped horse joyeux noel merry christmas an unofficial truce is declared soldiers get together fraternize for christmas during wwi arrival global governments including the russia china co operate during alien invasion edit wanted to add that my second example is based on actual events during wwii from dec there were unofficial ceasefires along the western front there are stories you can look up of soldiers on opposing sides of the war getting together exchanging gifts food and stories holding joint burial ceremonies having prisoner swaps playing football soccer and even having dinner together and carolling there are interesting historical stories documented about it all,"Sure, here is a brief summary of the provided text:

In social psychology, the concept of superordinate goals refers to situations where individuals who initially have conflicting interests ultimately find common ground and cooperate to achieve a shared objective that overrides their initial differences. This can lead to former rivals or enemies forming alliances or even becoming friends. 

The text gives two examples to illustrate this concept:

1. War horse: Two soldiers, initially on opposing sides, meet in a battlefield and put their differences aside to rescue a trapped horse they both care about. 2. Joyeux Noël: During World War I, there were unofficial truces between soldiers from different sides who came together to celebrate Christmas. They exchanged gifts, ate together, and even sang carols. 
These examples showcase how superordinate goals can lead to former enemies finding common cause and cooperating towards the greater good, even in the most unlikely of situations."
hey everyone have just come across trailer for rebel moon and it sounds like it could be really cool but little confused about as it seems to have both pg rated version are both versions releasing at the same time or is one version out sooner than the other and what actually gives the rated version its ratining compared to the pg version like is it extra violent gory adds sex nudity,"Rebel Moon is likely to get a PG-13 rating due to its inclusion of sci-fi violence. The PG version probably won't exist, or at the very least, won't be released at the same time as the PG-13 version. PG-13 content generally includes intense sci-fi violence and action."

mean the original black and white version is still there to watch they just added new version to help people who do not like black and white films to experience the movie in way that comfortable to them and maybe after watching it in color they decide to see it in the original black and white format me personally love color and it really makes everything pop so much more and gets my attention more understand preferences but do not understand why there so much hate and controversy towards it it not like it erasing the original version,"Some people are upset that new colorized versions of films are made because they believe that it is just changing the original work. However, people are entitled to their own opinions. On the one hand, some people believe that colorizing films might encourage people who dislike black and white to watch classics that they otherwise would miss. On the other hand, some people think that colorization takes away from the original film and changes the director's intent."
it seems too many people nowadays see movies as being disposable see so many people on facebook recommending random ass movies on tubi and what not some of these movies are utter nonsense that you instantly forget as the credits roll if gonna spend hours watching movie it better damn well be something that worth watching where the director actually has message and vision to express talking gone with the wind ben hur spider man type of stuff not saying spider man is on the same level as gwtw but that great movies come in many forms and levels don know how people could just waste hours watching stupid ass crap like the mail lady on tubi about mail lady stalking some guy and his family with horrible acting and cheap budget some movies are so filled with plot contrivances and bad acting that they make you question the movie even more like movie where black couple holds white baby doll acting like it their baby you can turn your brain off from shit like that,"A lot of people nowadays watch movies that are of poor quality and are disposable. Many movies nowadays lack a coherent message and vision and waste people's time. Instead of watching random movies, people should watch well-made films with good acting and coherent messages, even if they are not of award-winning quality."
not the most quotable movies but the movies with quotes that mean something to you for example watched atsv recently and it had some really good quotes like everyone keeps telling me how my story supposed to go nah imma do my own thing you don belong here you never did and my name is miles morales was bitten by radioactive spider think you know the rest jerk another movie with really good quotes was everything everywhere all at once with in another life would have loved just doing the taxes and laundry with you,"Certain movies may not be the most well-known, but they have meaningful quotes that resonate with the viewer. Two examples are ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" and ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" which have quotes that reflect themes of individuality and the appreciation of mundane aspects of life. These quotes stick with people long after they've finished watching these films."
literally what the title says maybe they played character you hated and you can unsee it maybe they just give off weird vibes personally jesse eisenberg daniel day lewis and benedict cumberbatch all rub me the wrong way honestly have no reason to dislike them and wish could get over it lol,"Some actors play characters that you cannot stand or give off unpleasant vibes. The dislike may have no particular reason and can be directed towards Jesse Eisenberg, Daniel Day-Lewis or Benedict Cumberbatch, for example, even though you wish you could get over it."
was watching the lookout as it was recommended in this sub liked the movie quite bit and kept feeling that few locations were bit familiar and sure enough it was shot in manitoba including winnipeg where live that is winnipeg manitoba in canada fair amount of movies are shot here and ve been lucky enough to work both in front of the camera and on crew in some very small aspects over the years so it not huge surprise but kind of cool going in for those who live in new york city or los angeles where so many movies are set and or filmed it of course not surprising to see familiar sights but for less famous locales it can be pretty interesting to those familiar with those places so my question has anyone else experienced this watching movie with no prior knowledge it was filmed in not set in your home city or town and then being surprised,"The Lookout is a movie that was filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The poster was surprised to learn this movie was filmed in their hometown as it portrays many familiar locations. Have you ever watched a movie, without prior knowledge, that was not set in your city nor shot there, but you were surprised to see many familiar locations?"
jesse eisenberg plays these weird messed up roles so well it got dark real fast adrien brody was charismatic as cult leader the bodybuilding scene attracts these incels jesse eisenberg went all red pill odessa young was nice addition we are all lost and trying to find meaning in this life we just want to belong and feel heard,"The characters played by Jesse Eisenberg often end up in peculiar situations and display unsettling behaviours. Eisenberg's charisma and commitment to these roles make for great performances. The movie also portrays the bodybuilding culture that tends to attract incel communities. Overall, the casting was well done, with Odessa Young being a nice addition to the starred cast."
some say he may have collapsed lung not to mention his arm is mangled where was he going to and what was his plan do not think field surgery would cut it here he need to go to hospital may have few broken ribs etc he looked like he was in fairly bad condition all round do you think he would have been apprehended shortly after by the police or would he have made it somewhere else would he have got bus to somewhere and received surgery from dodgy cartel doctor for example would he have survived that long have to say the other driver who crashed into him is an example of every crap driver in the world speeding ahead no situational awareness completely ignores the rules of the road impatient and then unsurprisingly an accident,"A man was driving on a road and was hit by another driver who was speeding and driving recklessly. As a result of the accident, the man's lung may have collapsed and his arm is mangled. It is likely that the man would have been caught by the police shortly after the accident or he would have sought out medical attention from a hospital or less legitimate source."
just random question that popped up for me after re watching that thing you do with my significant other tom hank character mr white seems to be aware of the band problems whenever there moment of tension in the band he always just standing there for moment in an act of foreshadowing he clearly knows that liv tyler and the lead singer are on shaky grounds so what does he do he pulls the infamous sorry girls he engaged stunt which leads to their breakup ve always assumed he had some ulterior motive for breaking them up he apparently buys them outright and gives them demands that they won live up to so in that way guess he gets to own their one hit wonder and they get dropped for breach of contract why else wouldn he intervene when he knows there problems so wanted to hate the guy but then caught that maybe he pulled that stunt because he could see the drummer and liz tyler had some chemistry so he was just doing them solid by pushing them together don know the movie really does stand the test of time it just so good in fun and campy way,"After re-watching 'That Thing You Do!' with Tom Hank's character Mr. White, you start to suspect that his intervention to break up the band has an ulterior motive. However, you begin to consider that it may have been done to push the drummer and Liz Tyler together because of their chemistry."

it took me few seconds to register this in my head the lights are out indy short round and the blonde get out of that bug cave and then this black bug big one crawls up the tv in silhouette slow reminded me of one of those exterminator commercials where people thought there was real bug on their tvs and they threw things at it breaking their tvs kept thinking is this the movie is this commercial what happening get up and it big beatle thank god not cockroach captured it and sent it on it way outside wished em the best of luck almost snapped pic but did not want to lose it but damn,"The darkness in the room obscured the figure at first, but soon a large bug resembling a beatle crawled up on the television screen. The narrator was reminded of an exterminator commercial and the idea that people sometimes hurt their televisions out of surprise or fear. They were able to get the bug to crawl outside, but the narrator wished them well as they feared the bug would have repercussions against them."
what movie that was only ever intended to be single film as opposed to franchise saga trilogy etc would you like to see sequel to universe that you like to see expanded on or maybe just character that you didn quite get your fill of from one single film bonus points to people who have suggestions for films that others may think would be ruined by sequel let hear those hot takes,"Which movies would you like to see sequels to, even if they were originally intended to be standalone films?

there are lot of talks nowadays about what female characters are supposed to be what qualities they should possess what traits they have to share with male characters and which traits should clearly separate them some people say that little girls need strong role models growing up while some say that modern female characters are just reskinned male characters from the nineties recently watched breakfast at tifanny and was shocked by how incredibly written the character of holly is she feels so real but at the same time come off as someone everybody wants to be but no one truly can and absolutely love that despite the tremendous charisma she has she is still deeply flawed person that has lot to learn in the course of the movie feel like lot of women at all eras were inspired by holly what do you think women who is your favorite heroine of all times men who is the favorite heroine of your wifes mothers and sisters let collect all the names,"There is a discussion nowadays about the traits female characters should have. Should they reflect strong women or rather depict feminine vulnerability? Many people admire Holly, a character from 'Breakfast at Tiffany's'. What are your thoughts on her? Who is your favorite female character? Share names!"
watched fincher the killer last night surprised it initially had such lukewarm reviews but imagine there might be sort of haute bias when critics see pure genre film at the venice film festival thought it was great film and distinctly modern take on classic genre particularly enjoyed how ambiguous its themes and ideas are really lends itself to multiple readings to me the film is cautionary parable suggesting that we might think that the best way to survive late stage capitalism and ultimately reach paradise is by casting off the final vestiges of our humanity however we will find that our paradise is an illusion tainted by our continuing psychological turmoil loved just the hint of reference to the killers origin story as if the film we are watching is actually part of longer series of narratives we are told that he was plucked out of law school by his handler hodges played magnificently by charles parnell who noticed methodical sociopathic potential and convinced fassbender character to pursue an alternative career path there lies more conventional anti hero character arch the story of sharp promising law student being recruited to be hitman by an older mentor becomes almost superhuman in his efficiency descending into depravity along the way film that would ve been pretty suitable years ago in pre digital capitalist society this film is much more about our current condition where our sleep deprived yet highly capable assassin be batting constantly interrupted by his smart watch complains to his boss about having to work overtime its been five days reminisces about time when his job was not so dull or isolating ve grown to appreciate proximity work staged accidents gradual poisonings anything with little creativity when was my last nice quiet drowning stuffs up his job for the first time and realises that despite his impressive record he is ultimately and instantly disposable after the killer finds his superficially attractive romantic interest has been beaten and maimed consequence of his profession and actions he promises to her brother that nothing like this will ever happen again he embarks on mission to at once seek revenge but also to absolutely ensure his and his partners future safety to do so he must kill most of the usual archetypes of the heros journey he starts with the child represented here by the youthful taxi driver he moves on to the father when he kills his handler hodges and the mother as represented by hodges secretary more traditionally via super impressive fight scene he overcomes the hyper masculine brute who is actually credited as the the brute and later kills tilda swinton temptress who also embodies sort of shadow self to our protagonist an assassin who lives amongst the normies semi integrating into the upper crust of western society in beacon ny instead of finding sanctuary in developing paradise to live out fantasy of feeling like one of the few finally he confronts the big bad what you might usually think of as the mastermind represented as the venture capitalist clay however instead of being genius he comes across as hapless buffoon instead of being threat the risk of keeping him alive but threatening him is lower than killing him even the billionaire venture capitalist is reluctant participant in the banal modern capitalist system of anonymous transactional evil he also nicely reflects our protagonists perfectionist aspirations problem solver who internal mantra would indicate cool genius but who regularly contradicts his inhumane ethos and makes dumb mistakes at the end of the film haven taken the money and escaped back to his paradise abode with his maimed girlfriend the killer reflects on how the need to be secure is slippery slope fate is placebo the only life path is the one behind you if in the brief time we are all given you cant accept this well maybe you are not one of the few maybe you are just like me one of the many as his eye twitches and the screen cuts to black our antihero has completed the antihero anti journey instead of achieving equanimity he indiscriminately vanquished the good and the bad he left the head of the snake intact when he realised it was not snake at all but just part of closed loop of capitalist shit fuckery he has dropped his aspirations to be one of the few he is allegedly content to be one of the many his beautiful yet vacuous vista tainted by the damage to his psyche after all he was not just killing to survive like the hunter he was in it for other reasons,"The film is a modern take on the classic genre, with an ambiguous message that lends itself to multiple readings. It hints at a cautionary parable, suggesting that casting off the last remnants of humanity in order to survive late-stage capitalism is futile. The main character, a assassin, embarks on a mission to seek revenge but also to ensure his and his partner's safety. The film reflects the protagonist's perfectionist aspirations and internal contradictions, ultimately suggesting that fate is a placebo and that the only life path is the one behind you."
ve been watching mike flanagan projects since oculus loved that movie and kept up with the director projects ever since keep noticing how many actors he manages to keep with him besides his wife know directors like scorese keep various actors on through the years but flanagan must be great because of how many of the same actors continually show up in his movies and tv shows and every new one finds way into the next or future venture anyone have any insight or opinion on this,"You've noticed that many of the actors in the director Mike Flanagan's movies and TV shows appear in multiple projects, and new actors seem to join him in his future projects as well. You're wondering if there's any information or opinions on this phenomenon."
spoiler why did the protagonist not admit he accidentally shot his partner it was convincing accident so he did not really have anything to worry about instead he lies about it and therefore has to preserve his lies by doing all these other bad acts and it just seemed to me that if he just admitted it it would have been written off as an unfortunate accident with no intention of manslaughter on his part unless am wrong thank you very much for any input on this,"You are wondering why the protagonist in the show lied about accidentally shooting his partner instead of just coming clean about it. You think that if he told the truth it would have been written off as an unfortunate accident and he would not have to commit further bad acts to cover it up. 

Did this summary help address your concerns about the show or plot?"
hey good evening want to ask if anyone knows about this film it is about lonely man in his early trying to make his life better but he does not know where to begin he is in shit job that gives him problems and all of his collegues bully him for being how he is he lives with his mother that constantly degrades him and later on in the movie he goes to aaa to speak about his problems then he meets female that feels some kind of the same because of this they start to hang out but because of some kind of problem she decides not continue with the relationship in this moment he starts to think about going to another country this so he can start all over and it finishes by him going to an airport and buying ticket to different country if you have an idea of the film am talking about please share the name would love to see it again,"A man, feeling lost and without purpose, decides to change his life. While he has problems with colleagues and his mother, he finds solace in a woman who understands him. When their relationship ends, he decides to start over in a new country. The movie is underscored by his quest for self-improvement and a better life. 

Does this summary match the film you are describing? If so, I think the name of this movie is ""Up in the Air"" (2009)."
my tl dr question has anyone else had success in buying these copies elsewhere spent very patient hour and half on chat session with google it was maddening but am patient uploading screenshots from my phone and two different laptop browsers logging in and out of multiple accounts there massive glitch also years ago google said they would automatically update film from standard to whenever it is available am not sure that is still happening if you already own the digital films you can not update and buy them although they are in the play store at for it just plays your original copy if you do not own them or are not logged in search for any of cameron remastered titles will show you can purchase them from organic search and when you jump into google play you ll see the for button but it buys the hd older version could not find way to purchase aliens to overwrite my prior hd copy but they told me it not the right one anyway they cannot see or find the aliens on their side they definitely cannot see it as when purchased the abyss it was the old version vs the new at with the extra minutes it was listed as and the filter in my library showed it but it was the old edition they also told me someone was on the phone with another agent that had the same problem for true lies anyone had success finding and watching it on any platform edit this thread is filled with unhappy people it bizarre good luck out there guys literally relating data streaming services do not seem to be updated properly and do not have the user interface to make it simple to find what returns in organic search there person that literally lied about amazon and not sure if it was for fun or what but what is the point of that and even though buy physical media they had the release date for digital and was excited during the christmas season when we had work downtime to watch it with my wife and people are attacking me it sorta surreal and the whole point of one way trip and wife are lines from the abyss geez not angry do not care but it is delightfully amusing quizzically enjoyable carry on,The agent at Google Play couldn't find a way to buy the updated version of Aliens when I tried to purchase it and they also couldn't see the film in their end when I tried to update my previous version of the film. Has anyone else had success buying the new Cameron remastered films elsewhere? Another agent was also on the phone with a customer about the same issue with True Lies.
hello there want to own obscure rated horror movies but from my extensive search it appears that they re impossible or incredibly expensive to find for vhs dvd on ebay am aware that can watch them on digital platforms such as tubi or amazon prime but want to be able to own physical copies of them because don like waiting for them to be released on platform and removed and or never released in the first place would be able to buy these digital films and transfer them to dvd what are my options,"You want to own physical copies of obscure horror movies, but they are hard to find on platforms like eBay.

the first is rightfully known most for its theft of the declaration of independence and the nd had to up that somehow and the realization that they re going to kidnap the president played by bruce greenwood is just exciting but if they did third where could they even go from there what could they possibly do to up the heist of the last two nic cage could get absolutely nuts in this one,"The movie's premise could go further by having the thieves kidnap the president after stealing the Declaration of Independence, but escalating events might be difficult to imagine."
what are some modern movie trailers that were exclusive to theaters and are now hard to find because the studio never placed them on youtube the first ones that come to my mind are the smile teaser that played with top gun maverick and the mean girls musical teaser that played with taylor swift the eras tour think the very first teaser for tenet also only played in theaters heck even though have my doubts that this existed ll even throw in the infamous teaser for where the wild things are that allegedly played with the grinch and was just the film title artwork with animals sounds can you think of any other theater exclusive trailers that are now hard to find,"Several movie trailers have been released exclusively in theaters, with the studios never releasing them online afterwards, making them hard to find. Among these trailers are teasers for Top Gun: Maverick, Mean Girls musical, Tenet, and Where the Wild Things Are."
loved the movie ocean when it came out my college roommate and would both come back from our am baseball practices before class put in ocean throw on some bacon and eggs and just enjoy it fun movie good character introduction sure cheadles accent is cartoon level british but oh well and well paced we could recite it line for line the movie ended with sense of accomplishment and wrapped up nicely was never thrilled they made second let alone third never saw it until couple years after and never really felt it fit the tone liked the laser scene but thats it the third one was kinda like bigger clunkier first one with less focus on the side characters anyways it is on tv right now which is my reason for posting this and it been number of year since ve seen it and it bringing me back to simpler time what are some other sequels out there that were completely unnecessary,"You should never underestimate the power of a good movie to take you back to a different time in your life. Ocean's Eleven is one of those movies for me. It was fun, had great characters, even if the sequel was unnecessary and lacked the same magic. What other movies take you back to a different time?"
united artists was created in by actors for actors so that actors could make the films they wanted to without having to seek studio approval it was bought and sold many times and eventually folded into mgm now that amazon bought mgm we ll probably never see ua listed as production studio again why are not actors investors and other rich people banding together to start their own studio to give the audiences the movies that some actors have lamented do not get made anymore not suggesting they create their streaming service that obviously as tough market but together group of actors and their rich investor friends could finance the movies they say streamers are no longer willing to make and then sell that finished film thereby recouping their investment and reasonable profit to studio to stream get that it always safer to play with someone else money scorsese making kotfm with apple cash but why is not this happening or is it happening but still on small scale it not possible to know about every single production like it was thirty years ago so grant might there might be things going on am unaware of,"United Artists was formed by actors so they could make the films they wanted to without studio interference. Since wealthy people are now financing films, why aren't actors and wealthy people investing in creating new production studios, financing the films they want to make, and selling them to streamers to recoup their money? 

Is this happening on a small scale, or is it simply unknown because of the number of productions occurring today? 

Apple financed Scorsese's latest film, for example."

tired of movies where there one cool character and you re just the plain person supporting the cool one and hating the bad for instance the departed is great example where you re not sure whom to root for although maybe that not quite the right example or maybe the devil advocate,"You're tired of movies where you feel like you're rooting for the wrong character, or where you feel like you're the boring character just supporting the cool one. Two examples of this are The Departed where you're not sure who to root for, or The Devil Advocate where you hate the antagonist."
usually whenever you watch romance between two characters there have been times where it ll feel forced that not entirely convinced that they don actually love each other or the movie should just drop the storyline of them falling in love all together but often there are also sometimes where the chemistry the actors have felt so natural that felt very eager to see them get together whether they actually become couple or not is there any movie or even show you ve seen where the romantic or emotional chemistry between two characters felt so real you were convinced that there was genuine love and compassion there that you needed to see them get together,"Have you seen any movies or shows where the chemistry between the characters was so strong you were convinced they loved each other?

young guy in his have heard of the famous name arnold schwarzenegger my whole life and can clearly place the face brand etc know the classic films and iconic one liners but it not until randomly decided to watch his documentary arnold on netflix that learning how stratospheric his influence was they even said that from the his popularity cultural relevance was basically unmatched curious how this compares to the rock one of if not the biggest movie star today and one of the most recognizable people in the world guess curious at their respective peaks which of the two was more famous recognizable popular please keep nostalgia out of this as much as you can,"People know Arnold Schwarzenegger from his movies, but his documentary, Arnold, reveals the extent of his influence.

my siblings and were talking about this the other night specifically we were discussing all of the movies we went back and saw several times because they were so cheap men in black the matrix austin powers and varsity blues the spice girls movie george of the jungle and hell we even went back for second viewing of the phantom menace the parris island and the mcas beaufort movie theaters definitely kept us out of trouble in the summertime edit have had such good time reading everyone comments love how simple thing like cheap movie ticket can create so many memories,"Certain movies stand out in my mind as ones that my siblings and I saw multiple times in theaters because they were cheap. These movies included Men in Black, The Matrix, Austin Powers, Varsity Blues, and Spice World, among others. Cheap movie tickets entertained us during the summers as kids."
can help but feel like the adults making this movie knew exactly what they were doing and it great the cgi is sooooo bad but the actors don seem to be hating it at all the story is absolutely silly and it hard not to laugh at every major part of the film as an adult however any kid younger than isn going to see how bad it is it really captures the essence that films don have to be serious or overly artistic to be good movie and serve purpose,"This movie seems to be intentionally bad in terms of its CGI and story, but kids might not notice it and instead enjoy it. For adults, it might be enjoyable because it's so bad and silly. It captures the idea that movies don't have to be serious to be good."
ve got my answer the green knight spoilers obviously either the main character died or he lived it unclear to me it like ending movie where the main character won either million dollars or the real prize the friends he made along the way some people might say that beautiful think it sucks what are your answers,"The movie ends with the main character possibly winning a million dollars or earning the real prize with the friends he made along the way, but some viewers think the ending is unclear because it is not revealed whether the main character lived or died."
we were talking about our favorite funny movies and new friend of mine mentioned the shining was surprised the shining is funny asked it hilarious he replied he went on to describe how everybody was overacting on purpose especially jack nicholson to the point of becoming like caricatures or cartoon characters admitted some parts were kind of funny but it was the funniness you associate with mental imbalance like crazy person like tommy devito being funny joe pesci character in goodfellas he disagreed even wendy playing the weak ineffective wife in such an exaggerated way he said it was hilarious so have you or somebody you know ever had unique reaction to movie that differed from most other people,"Your friend finds The Shining funny because of how over-the-top actors played their roles, like Jack Nicholson, who played the lead role of Jack Torrance. Your friend compares it to a caricature and jokes about it being funny like a mentally unbalanced person, like a character in Goodfellas.  You want to know if other people had similar reactions to The Shining."
charlie kaufman is genius and it blows my mind that this movie had lukewarm reception it has kubrick level of intention and detail every single line every imagery furthers the characterization and themes of the movie just raw liminal existential study it places you in state of complete and loneliness does not let go it surreal and magical and otherworldly read the book and loved it by the way and maybe that alleviated the confusion element lot of people had when watching the movie but thought kaufman interpretation was timeless and brilliant he took classic horror and turned into an existential story about time aging isolation and disconnection it the kind of movie that absolutely lingers with you and you could watch dozen times and catch new glimpses of brilliance each viewing also think everyone should yms analysis of it on youtube it brilliant,"You should watch Charlie Kaufman's movie as it is a timeless and brilliant interpretation of classic horror, turned into an existential story about time, aging, isolation, and disconnection. This movie is a raw liminal existential study that places the viewer in a state of complete loneliness and does not let go. It is surreal and magical and otherworldly. Reading the book first may help, but even without it, this movie is a mindblower, leaving you with new glimpses of brilliance each viewing. Check out YouTube analyses of this movie, especially YMS's take on it."
random shower thought had but were any movies just casually progressive like that feel like there definitely fairly popular movie in the or with black president but completely blanking just curious cause know as soon as obama became president every movie casually switched to having black presidents and now we ve gone back to lot more white presidents in movies lol not that it really matters just find it interesting,"You may have noticed that there were fewer movies featuring Black presidents after Obama was elected in real life, and more depictions of White presidents thereafter. This is merely a observation about Hollywood's propensity to reflect societal trends in film. 

Did you have a specific movie in mind when you had this thought?"
first of all love this movie not sure why it took me almost years to finally watch it watched both the theatrical and director cut do have random question about scene could not quite figure out baldwin comes to terms with saladin and then comes to punish the reynald guy why did he have him kiss his bare hand was he trying to give him leprosy as punishment was it symbolic as in am condemning you to death could not really figure out the kiss of peace thing,"You ask why Baldwin has the Reynald guy kiss his hand. You wonder if it was meant to give him leprosy or symbolize condemnation to death. You are unsure what the significance is of the kiss of peace. 

I can provide some insight into the scene you describe. 

In the movie, the kiss of peace is a symbolic act of contempt and a cruel gesture of power. By making Reynald kiss his bare hand, Baldwin is emphasizing his own purity and superiority over Reynald, who is contaminated by sin and corruption. 

The hand kiss is a gesture of humility and submission, acknowledging Reynald's defeat and lower status. By forcing him to kiss his hand, Baldwin is asserting his dominance and superiority over Reynald. 

This act is a powerful way to demonstrate Reynald's humiliation and defeat, reinforcing the message that Baldwin is a powerful leader who upholds justice and righteousness."
this is question for those who are members of angel studios just finished watching the shift excellent movie btw highly recommend and at the end the actor who played kevin the main character talks about how if you did the angel studios pay it forward you can get access to an exclusive extra scene from the movie to enhance the original story even more where do find this extra scene through the app tried scanning the qr code again but that didn actually work at loss,"You can unlock an exclusive extra scene from the movie The Shift by scanning a QR code through the Angel Studios app by paying it forward through their platform, but you need instructions to do so. 

Would you like these instructions? 

Please let me know if you have any other questions about the movie or other entertainment inquiries!"
hi all my friend was talking about the movie less than zero today and told them that the scene where they shoot up between their toes made me so nauseated that had to leave party and lay down but my friend is telling me that does not happen in this movie but also do not want to watch it again it damaged me am misremembering this,"You are unsure if you remember correctly that a scene in the movie Less Than Zero made you feel nauseous and compelled you to leave the party and lay down because it involved toes being shot up. Your friend claims this is not a scene in the movie, but you do not want to rewatch it to verify. 

Did this summary help?"
was just thinking with saw xi being officially in the making that tobin bell will have played john kramer jigsaw times in his career same for vin diesel when fast comes out both actors were not present in or films in their respective series with tobin not being in spiral photograph doesnt count and vin in fast furious and hobbs shaw rounding out in cant think of any actor that reached double digits in playing the same role is this record in how many times an actor has reprised their respective character,"Two notable actors who have reprised their roles as iconic villains numerous times are Tobin Bell and Vin Diesel. Bell played John Kramer, also known as Jigsaw, in the Saw franchise, excluding Spiral, and Vin Diesel played Dominic Toretto in the Fast & Furious franchise, excluding 2 Fast 2 Furious. These actors have portrayed their notorious characters in the majority of their franchise's films, setting a record for recurring roles in villainous portrayals."
how is he not yet knighted isaacs first terrified me as lucius malfoy but as grew older revered him for the stoicism and creating stand out character whose acting is on par with richard harris or rickman the patriot convinced me he might have the perfect villain face with those pursed lips and thousand yard stare however his filmography is extensive years worked meaning his projects were either small or the series was short lived do you consider him in the elite category in the same vein as other stars or should he be praised but still level below eta elite meter currently stands at dead queen knows who he is everyone hates his characters but loves his acting no sword awarded,"Isaacs has an extensive career in film and television but has yet to receive a knighthood. His stoicism and remarkable acting skills have garnered him praise and earned him a place in the elite category of actors. However, his career is lacking recognition in terms of prestigious projects or awards. Fans admire his talent but feel he deserves further recognition from official institutions."
hello movie enthusiasts next year plan on watching film day suppose you could say it new year resolution but don know if sitting in front screen every night is exactly beneficial to my life lol however would love if you could recommend films for me to watch any genre as would love to broaden my horizons also don miss out some of the big movies because may not have watched them thank you for your help,"Next year, I plan on dedicating more time to watching more films as a hobby. I'd like to get recommendations for movies to watch that span various genres, so I can experience a greater variety of films and broaden my horizons."
there nothing love more than cosmic horror and looking for movies that are similar to the ones listed above the dream movie for me would be combination of cosmic horror found footage and liminal space as these are by far my top favourite sub genres just know there some hidden gems ve missed and intend to watch them all before next year,"Nothing excites more than movies that combine the elements of cosmic horror and found footage, with liminal space being a bonus favorite subgenre. They adore the thrill and scare cosmic horror movies offer and have yet to watch some hidden gems in the genre. Their dream movie would be a fusion of their favorite elements all in one film."
if there one thing that always cracks me up about high definition re releases of older movies especially action movies it that the added resolution and detail really brings into sharp focus the differences between the principal actors and their stunt doubles just watching true lies in its new form and almost every stunt scene with arnie and with art malik has very obvious stunt double that don really look that similar when viewed through the lens of picture how do new movies avoid this do they just cgi the actors face over the stunt double,High definition resolutions of older action movies highlight the differences between the main actors and their stunt doubles. This is avoided in modern movies by CGI'ing the actor's face over the double.
why are there little to no movies about female cheater getting her just desserts just watched survival island and the first wives club and thought to myself if there where any movies where the female cheater actually gets punished for her actions the same way male cheater would in movies like there are so many where guy just gets destroyed for cheating on his significant other while there seems to be none on the opposite end of the spectrum making this post as am curious also looking for movie recommendations,"You rarely see movies where a female cheater is punished for their actions the way it happens to male cheaters in movies.  I'm looking for movies that depict female cheaters getting what they deserve. 

Would you know any movies that fit this description?"
so of course we have the traditional revenge movies involving mafia cartel bond type villains and thoroughly enjoy them almost tirelessly but does anyone know of any movies or tv series where the villains are like blue bloods inherited wealth corporate types or even white collar criminals suffering little bit from jelly of the month club syndrome this time of year and would like some fantastical movie revenge thanks in advance for any suggestions,"You want suggestions for revenge movies or series where the villains are wealthy and act like the ""jelly of the month club syndrome""? Here are a few suggestions: ""Knives Out"", ""Ocean's Eleven"", ""The White Lotus"", and ""Greed"". These movies offer a range of narratives, from mystery to heist, showcasing the corrupt and malicious nature of the wealthy."
just like one previous post of mine asked this very question on askreddit recently and figured out posting it here would probably be more fitting when talking about sad scenes in movies the majority of what gets mentioned are scenes of character death understandably but that exact notion makes it all the more interesting to try and name sad scene that is not death scene my two personal favourites of this would be the last scene of pursuit of happyness jessie backstory from toy story what are yours,"Some of the most emotional movie scenes are when a character dies, but what about sad scenes that aren't death scenes? This prompt discusses a few examples and asks readers to share their favorite emotional scenes that don't involve death."
am huge fan of psychological horror and the unique storylines that come with it hereditary was the first psychological horror movie watched it was pretty sick and disturbing movie but the way it messes with your brain kind of excites me it weird frequencies in the music and it odd camera angles and jump scares are what made me so interested in psychological horror the thing find weird about psychological horror though is that many people are not fan yet they enjoy the usual jump scares and normal horror slasher movies could be wrong but believe the reason for this is that lot of people are probably extremely terrified of what humans are capable of speaking on midsommer and hereditary it being weird cult storyline is honestly really realistic as to what some people might believe in this world for example the jonestown massacre and peoples temple another example if many have not seen the strange things about the johnsons that also an incredibly sick and disturbing short film that realistically could occur somewhere in our world so my question is for people who do not enjoy psychological horror why is that is it because it too real,"You enjoy psychological horror because it messes with your brain, with strange music, odd camera angles, and jump scares. You find the cult storyline in Midsommar realistic because there are many groups like it in the real world, like the Jonestown massacre and Peoples Temple. Why do people dislike psychological horror when it seems more realistic than other horror genres?"
ve read good things in this sub about the dollars trilogy so this past weekend decided give them all watch but did not make it all the way through watched fistfull of dollars and then quit halfway through for few dollars more this was not my first time trying to sit through classic western ve tried others in the past and had the same experience find them goofy slow and difficult to take seriously it was hard to care about anything that happened in fistfull as there practically no character development at all the stakes feel really low so all the tension falls flat and the movie turns into just bunch of randoms shooting each other in desert it all fells really forced and melodramatic seems pretty consistent across the genre newer neo westerns wind river no country for old men to yuma tombstone are some of my favorite movies so maybe it the age that causing the disconnect edit for context promise not trying to shit on spaghetti westerns understand it beloved genre by many just trying to understand why,"You find westerns, like Fistful of Dollars, slow and difficult to take seriously.  You wonder if it's just this genre or era, because you enjoy more recent westerns like Wind River and No Country for Old Men.  You wonder if it's just that there is insufficient character development to grip you in the former. 
You are not alone in finding this genre initially inaccessible, despite its many beloved classics. 

Would you like assistance in finding other western films that are slower paced than usual, in case the pace is indeed the issue, or western films with stronger character development than usual? 

Would you like assistance in finding resources that discuss the evolution of the western genre and its tropes, which might help you to better understand and appreciate the films you've been watching?"

always assumed it was history course as senior in high school which think ferris is supposed to be would have been taking american history ii however rewatched it today and ben stein is taking really deep dive at one point he starts talking about the laffer curve which had never heard of googling it took me to investopedia despite taking two semesters of economics in college do not remember learning about this rule get that the comedic schtick here is supposed to be that ben stein is boring teacher out of touch with his students levels and interests so he teaching something way above their heards but kinda find his lecture interesting connecting the era tariff act with reaganomics is pretty interesting found myself saying ok go on anyway maybe it was some kind of ap economics course or something,"Ben Stein, as a teacher in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, delivers a surprisingly insightful lesson on the Laffer curve and its relationship to the Tariff Act and Reaganomics, which catches the interest of the viewer. This intriguing segment suggests that the character of Stein may be teaching an advanced economics course, implying Ferris's absence from school that day may have been fortuitous."
when the movie came out was still pretty young all remember was that josh from drake and josh was in it and they were trapped inside by some killer outside remember liking it but that could ve just been because josh was in it have not seen it since it came out does anyone remember if it as bad as the reviews say online,"You're describing the 2007 film, ""Superbad"", starring Jonah Hill and Michael Cera as Seth and Evan, two high school seniors who set out to get alcohol for a party. The film also starred Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fogell, their awkward friend who obtains a fake ID, and Jason Segel as their classmate Nick. ""Superbad"" received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success."
the alpha male allegedly has been observing robert enough to know how to psychologically manipulate him he knew seeing fred out of the library would make him lose it him dressing up as fred to make him think the manequin itself moved and then putting it in his place when rob wasnt looking proved he had the mental capacity to understand his behaviour and way of thinking what im getting at is the alpha male most definetly understood rob catching his lover alive meant he would keep her alive proven later on when we realise he swarmed the hideout specifically to take her back secondary ending now considered canon wich brings the question why release the dogs in the first place if he needed rob alive the outcome was unpredictable at least on his part plus he knew his boogieman was hurt from the trap,"In order to manipulate Robert, the Alpha Male dressed up as Fred, set up a mannequin, and then ambushed Robert when he was nearby. Alpha Male released the dogs intentionally at Rob's hideout, but given Rob's injury, it is unclear if Alpha Male expected Rob to survive, or if he was trying to kill Rob outright, or if he merely wanted to retrieve Rose alive."
although jordan peele has only directed three feature films his latest outing nope just feels like the pinnacle of his filmmaking excellence sizeable departure from more grounded horror movie in get out to more grandiose horror movie that is just way more layered thematically what about you guys,"Jordan Peele's Nope is a monumental step up from his previous horror films, Get Out and Us, receiving more acclaim for its grandiose storytelling and exploration of themes. Peele has certainly established himself as a legendary filmmaker in the horror genre."
think about it aladdin loner with self esteem issues and an animal companion who wants to rise above the ranks and be someone to get the girl of his dreams gets help from tex avery esque cab calloway influenced reality warper who spends his time breaking the th wall making wildly exaggerated facial expressions and pop culture references and faces against treacherous antagonist who also wants to rise above the ranks but does so with unsavory methods the nutty professor shy but sweet man who gets treated like garbage by most of the people around him gets an alter ego who represents his repressed sexuality who has lower inhibitions and is the toast of the town but can be pain to be around and ultimately has to find balance between both sides of his personality all three share the theme of being yourself and before you mention the comic book this film has pretty much nothing to do with that,"The movie is about Aladdin, a loner with self-esteem issues, who wants to rise above his station and win the heart of the woman he dreams about. He gets help from Tex Avery-esque Cab Calloway-influenced reality warper who aids him in his quest, but Aladdin faces a treacherous antagonist who uses underhanded methods to achieve the same goals. The Nutty Professor is about a shy man who creates an alter ego to express his repressed sexuality and must find a balance between both sides of his personality. The theme of all three stories is about being true to oneself."
was watching hereditary and remembered how much adored toni collette so looked up her filmography and was blown away to learn that she australian and that got me thinking is there even one american actor that has played european or other english speaking roles so convincingly maybe this is stupid question since only talking about list hollywood actors but just curious from the uk australian perspective,"After watching Toni Collette in Hereditary, the user was surprised to learn that she is Australian and began wondering if there are any American actors who have convincingly played European roles, specifically in Hollywood.  The user is curious from the perspective of someone in the UK or Australia.  Toni Collette is known for her exceptional acting skills, which have allowed her to take on a variety of roles, including those that are not necessarily reflective of her Australian background.  The user's question stems from a broader interest in the versatility and skills of actors who can effectively transform themselves into diverse characters."
has it ever happened where movie that is not even based on food suddenly has certain elements to it that just makes your mouth water like that prison food scene in goodfellas but back to phantom thread it all begins with that scene where daniel day lewis character ordering that sumptuous breakfast for the first time to the way he delicately eats it set to johnny greenwood well seasoned score as an uncultured yank suddenly had this uncontrollable urge to have welsh rarebit ngl genuinely thought he was talking about rabbit from to the scene where alma cooks for reynolds to be honest found nothing wrong with the way she cooked those greens to the other where she elegantly chops up mushrooms to put into his omelette poisoned sure but my tongue was already poisoned by the grilled cheese was chomping on while watching it so enjoyed him take bite of it that among many other scenes really makes my mouth water not only is the film joy to watch with its well crafted art direction score theme and pacing but the acting coupled with the well thought out framing makes it such feast for the senses this movie is filled with such delicately shot scenes that really make my mouth water can never watch this movie on an empty stomach there this lovely article from the new yorker which details more about what talking about curious has there ever been non food movie that has become your unofficial go to food movie to binge while eating,"Certain movies can inspire cravings just by depicting food on screen, even if the film isn't actually about food. The movie ""Phantom Thread"" is filled with scenes that made the narrator hungry, from the breakfast ordered by Daniel Day-Lewis' character to the cooking of Alma, played by Vicky Krieps, despite the fact that her cooking is portrayed as poisonous. The article discusses how cinematography, like framing and art direction, can influence viewers' senses and make them hungrier than ever."
really enjoyed warrior rob roy and law abiding citizen as films however despite the relevance to the storyline do not care for the outcomes of the final battles with warrior tommy seemed the character most in need and deserving of victory regardless of what that would have meant to him in rob roy archbald cunningham is clearly the more skilled swordsman and despite his despicable actions in the film do not appreciate watching him lose to an inferior fighter in the final scene with law abiding citizen well you all have read the arguments before any others you feel the same about am also happy to listen to counterpoints arguments against the above points,"You enjoyed the movies 'Warrior Rob Roy' and 'Law Abiding Citizen', but felt dissatisfied with the outcomes of the final battles in both films. In 'Warrior Rob Roy', you think Tommy deserved to win against Archibald Cunningham, despite his superior swordsmanship. In 'Law Abiding Citizen', you think the villain Cunningham should have lost to the hero due to his despicable actions. You want to hear arguments against this viewpoint."
really enjoy hitchcock movie rope and part of the reason love it so much is it is basically just very good well thought out morality play one setting for the whole movie virtually no action just group of characters sitting around and basically giving audiences debate on things like eugenics and the morality behind murdering those you deem undesirable jimmy stewart goes from being very elitist and cold in abstract to discovering morality when the ideas start to become more real and then he basically becomes the voice of the audience lot of movies that try to be moral plays just suck at it what are some other good ones,"You should watch Rope (1948) by Alfred Hitchcock if you enjoy well-thought-out films that pose moral questions. Set in a single setting, the film explores themes of eugenics and morality through a group of characters who engage in a debate about killing those deemed undesirable. The story follows Jimmy Stewart as he transforms from an elitist who is coldly abstract about these moral questions to the voice of the audience, ultimately coming to understand the complexity of morality when ideas are brought into the real world."
this piece of art is easily my favorite movie of all time was hoping someone could suggest other movies with similar vibes story extra plus for french but not demand quirky lovable beautiful and score to die for love the details and the storytelling the characters are all their own and shows comic but inspiring look into people and their everyday lives and the biggest plus is the amazing cinematography anyone,"You could give the following movies a try based on your favorite movie, which seems to be imbued with French style, quirky characters, beautiful cinematography, and inspiring storytelling:

1. ""Amélie"" (2001) - A charming French film about a woman who decides to help those around her and in turn rediscovers her own humanity.

2. ""Before Sunset"" (2004) - A contemplative and intimate French drama about reconnecting with lost love, it shares similar themes of everyday humanity and following one's dreams despite obstacles. 

3. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014) - This one has intricate styling and cinematography, quirky characters, and an entertaining story that combines comedy and drama. 

4. ""Goodbye, Lenin!"" (2003) - This German film tells the story of a young man who struggles to keep his mother ignorant of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the changes taking place in East Germany. 

5. ""The Princess Bride"" (1987) - An eccentric fairytale adventure that combines comedy, romance, and action.

hello fellow cinephiles can get some good tragicomedy dramedy film indications really fond of martin mcdonagh and the coen brothers filmography but like to watch movies of that genre from different countries different times and different languages if you also know other directors that make movies with that same type of humor would appreciate as well,"You want suggestions for tragicomedy movies, preferably from different countries and languages, as you are a fan of Martin McDonagh and the Coen Brothers, who are famous for this genre.

film is an exciting combination of different media and approaches to connecting with people some focus more on particular elements over others or draw their success differently some succeed in some ways and fail in others would be interesting to me to hear which films succeed when part of that experience is heightened and part is removed bet the answers to these questions will give me new appreciation for certain films,"There are many different aspects to film, and filmmakers have many different goals they may want to achieve. Films can have a huge impact on the audience, and sometimes filmmakers will focus on one aspect to connect with their audience. It would be interesting to see which films succeed when focusing on one element and removing another. This could give insight into which aspects are the most important to the success of a film."

presume everyone on this sub has seen fight club possibly presume incorrectly but it does not lack for comments or discussion wanted to know if anyone had film suggestions where the story is filtered through the main protagonist or one of the lead characters and then at some point in the movie the pov shifts to another character because of story point fight club identity with john cusack psycho for obvious reasons the dark half secret window stephen king does this lot in his work,"I am looking for movie suggestions where the story is filtered through the main protagonist, but at some point, the point of view shifts to another character due to a story point.

obviously we all know the famous scrubbing of all texture with the release ve just been scanning through true lies and the abyss in and it looks like while not as bad he been scrubbing away again considering the man is obviously master of his craft know that this concious decision of his but cannot figure out why the titanic release was pretty darn good so know he capable does anyone have any ideas,"The scrubbing of texture in recent releases of James Cameron's films, such as ""True Lies"" and ""The Abyss,"" has been noted by film enthusiasts. Despite Cameron's expertise, the decision to diminish texture in his films remains unclear. The exception to this trend is the highly acclaimed ""Titanic"" release, which raises questions about the purpose behind the texture scrubbing in his other films."
been thinking about how some of the best dramatic movies also have some of the best individual comedic moments but do not think that aspect of those movies gets appreciated enough most recently watched braveheart and the joke did not think you were in the tent that long is pretty solid what are some more hilarious bits from serious movies,"You appreciate the comedic moments in serious movies as much as the dramatic parts of them, but feel that the jokes in these films don't get the attention they deserve. Braveheart's joke about not thinking someone was in a tent long enough is one example, but you are curious to know other hilarious bits from serious movies.

do not know why but ve always loved it when two characters who should hate each other are able to respect each other without taking away from their conflict examples include lighting faraday cigarette in the magnificent seven ultron and vision last conversation in age of ultron or achilles and priam in troy scenes contain spoilers what are your favorite moments of respect and civility between enemies,"You enjoy it when characters who are enemies or otherwise hate each other, nevertheless exhibit moments of respect and civility towards one another, finding these moments particularly compelling as they do not detract from the tension between the characters.

someone had posted review of current superhero movie they went to watch in theaters that had made them fall asleep halfway into the film there are couple films that left me on snooze either because was sick and could not keep myself awake long enough till the meds kicked in or because had no initial interest in watching the film to begin with but friend did not want to watch it alone and so find myself waking up halfway into the movie still uninterested with it do not recall the name but it was on netflix and it starred arnold schwarzenegger could not keep myself up watching the film and found myself going in and out at times explains why cannot remember the title would not call it forgettable cause everyone has different taste in things but do not think could bring myself to rewatch it again this got me pondering the question what was that movie or movies that had made you fall asleep whether it be in theaters at home at friend place or with partner,"Someone posted a review of a current superhero movie they watched in theaters that they fell asleep halfway through.

in your opinion what actor or actress was casted for role that they just were not mesnt for either they were terrible in or they just were not fit for that role why do you think that who do you think would have been better fit if anyone on the director side who do you think was wrong to direct,"Some actors or actresses may not be well-suited for roles they are cast in, whether it is due to a lack of fit with the character or a failure to portray the role convincingly.

Do you have an actor or actress in mind who you think was miscast in a role? Feel free to share your thoughts!"
tl dr reasons it might be trilogy it the same actor playing very similar role as an unnamed drifter protagonist in the same outfit in for fistful of dollars and subsequently in for few dollars more does not that sound like sequel it makes sense that the good the bad and the ugly is prequel and even features him gathering the outfit he wears in the other two cannot find any record of anyone involved saying they re not series reasons it might not be lee van cleef and gian maria volont play different characters in different entries but actors play different characters in different installments of other series too the man with no name was coined by united artists but that just marketing slogan and has nothing to do with anything some people claim without sources that leone or eastwood or someone said this in an interview somewhere update after day seems pretty clear that they are trilogy as is implied in the original films what weird urban legend that popped up that they are not update humpthedog says such an interview may exist on the th or anniversary of the releases it would be appreciated if anyone could confirm deny this will try to check this was discussed in recent thread but do not think it reached satisfying conclusion searched online and found some older threads and other things that also did not have any real proof the movies do not share any plot and can absolutely be watched in any order clint eastwood plays very similar character who wears the same outfit in all of them in trying to research this this morning can find lots of random people online claiming that sergio leone or clint eastwood or others involved with the movies have stated in interviews that they were not intended to be trilogy cannot find anyone actually linking to these interviews or naming magazine they were in or anything and cannot find any interviews where they address the issue myself either can find some non authoritative sources like wikipedia which cites american filmmaker ernest farino in retrofan magazine ie someone also do not see any reason to think they would actually know what they re talking about claiming the idea they re trilogy was thought up by united artists this screenrant article even says american distributor united artists were the first to come up with the notion of the man with no name and therefore the notion of corralling these films as trilogy which seems to be explicitly acknowledging that it just an assumption based off ua coining the man with no name for marketing coining marketing slogan has nothing to do with whether leone thought of them as trilogy when he was making them some people point out that his character is are actually named and named differently in each film specifically one character in fistful of dollars calls him joe which is sometimes used generically like buddy out of the blue in for few dollars more everyone calls him manco which means one armed and in the good the bad and the ugly everyone calls him blondie think that these are all nicknames and that the man with no name was not ua missing that but rather them noticing that his real name is never given in any of them nameless drifter or nameless drifters being given different nicknames in different towns does not imply anything either way to me the italian titles of the first two per un pugno di dollari for fistful of dollars and per qualche dollaro in pi for few dollars more do seem to imply sequel relationship in fistful of dollars at we can clearly see gravestone dated so the movie takes place at least then in for few dollars more at colonel douglas lee van cleef finds newspaper article about manco clint eastwood killing the morton brothers dated so the movie takes place at least then the good the bad and the ugly is set during the new mexico campaign of the us civil war in this means that even if they were intended to be standalone the good the bad and the ugly takes place first the fact that we see blondie eastwood gather the outfit that eastwood character wears wear in the other two suggests to me that it was intended to be prequel some people point to lee van cleef playing both colonel douglas in for few dollars more and angel eyes in the good the bad and the ugly as evidence that it not trilogy but do not think re using actors in different roles proves that for example in the james bond series joe don baker played arms dealer brad whitaker in the living daylights but plays cia agent jack wade in goldeneye so is there any actual reason that some people are so convinced they re not supposed to be trilogy see some things that suggest they were intended to be one and while totally accept that it not definitive do not think it definitive the other way either in particular if anyone knows where to actually find one of those interviews where leone or eastwood or anyone actually says they were not intended to be trilogy would love to see them,"While there is no definitive proof, there are many reasons to believe that the Dollars Trilogy was intended to be a trilogy. Clint Eastwood plays a very similar character in all three films, and the plot points of the films when aligned tell a chronological story. There is a rumor that Sergio Leone or Clint Eastwood stated in an interview that the films were not intended to be a trilogy, but nobody seems to be able to find this interview. 

Can anyone find the interview that proves this theory wrong?"
surprised the ending of this movie is seen as low point even by people who like it because to me think it got multiple meanings beyond the surface of there rat in movie about rats the simplest reading is that it just that simple funny in joke to end on but do think it got bit more to it and that why like it it makes you laugh seeing rat but you think about it and there few things to gleam from it obviously some of these readings do require thinking outside of the box and adding these kinds of spiritual aspects but like doing that it billy costigan re incarnation stepping in he was rat himself though heroic one basically just living in another form and getting the last laugh it frank costello re incarnation stepping in again getting the last laugh by living he himself was also rat since he was working with the fbi in whitey bulgar like fashion colin sullivan has just been turned into rat perhaps as punishment for the kind of person he was turned into what he truly was and punished for it the rat just symbolises any of the above and is not literally any of those things the rat is just rat but that the point we humans are so complex to the point to where we chose to designate person betraying their group and feeding information to another group as rat who not capable of that and is just an animal it humourous acknowledgement that rats are just animals not capable of webs of decent and destruction or that humans are way more animalistic than they like to believe the rat specifically being rat is not that important if anything it more symbolic of dignam basically being the last man standing after all the death and destruction and it ironic because dignam was the only one of the major characters who was not himself rat in some way but he did basically avenge billy the most heroic of the rats so it placement here makes sense maybe these explanations will not make you like the scene any more than you do but disagree with the notion that it just silly meaningless and unsubtle low point of an otherwise strong crime drama thriller,"Although many people enjoy the movie, the ending depicting a rat is controversial. Some believe it is a joke, while others think it is deeper, for example, it could be a symbol for the characters who were rats, or it could be pointing out the difference between humans and rats, or perhaps it is an inside joke referencing one of the characters in the film."
looking for examples of movies that take bit of right turn and have the pov apparent protagonist surprisingly shift later into the movie half an hour in or midway etc particularly in the horror thriller genre examples that come to mind spoilers incoming are things like death proof cabin in the woods psycho and then there are similar things that take big surprising narrative swings like from dusk til dawn which feel spiritually similar but not the same thing examples of both types would be useful if anyone has any ideas thanks in advance for any assistance,"I'm looking for movies in the horror/thriller genre that have a surprising shift in the narrative halfway through the story, similar to movies like Death Proof, Cabin in the Woods, or Psycho. The shift should occur around a half hour into the movie and change the perspective of the apparent protagonist. Can you think of any examples? 

(Note: Another movie that somewhat fits this description is ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", although it's not quite the same kind of shift you're looking for.) 

Remember to spoiler tag any movie examples you wish to share! 

Would you like me to help you brainstorm other movie ideas or themes you could explore?"
watched the survival thriller movie fall on starz and thought it was pretty good for the genre of people being trapped in life threatening situation movies which do not normally pay much attention too did anyone else like it experienced fear of heights from the comfort of my recliner trying to contemplate what that would be like did search for other threads for this film but only found lots of discussions about the season the movie made profit on million budget based on what read at wikipedia and sequel or similar film might be planned other films that have given me similar fear the walk and the hang from the crane scene in nerve,You should watch Fall on Starz if you enjoy survival thrillers and films that depict people trapped in life-threatening situations. This movie left you with a sense of fear of heights and made you contemplate what it would be like to experience such a fear. You recommend this movie to others who enjoy similar films such as The Walk and Nerve.
generally heist movies following the same format wanting or needing to steal something for profit revenge because you are forced to assembling crew coming up with rube goldberg like plan dealing with adversity when something goes wrong getting away with it or not which movie does the best job at each of these parts mine wanting to steal something christopher nolan has an incredibly creative idea in inception to steal something from someone dream assembling crew this is the bread and butter of this genre oceans shows what everyone talent is the town shows how life long friends from charlestown interact with each other ronin also does good job of assembling seemingly eclectic group of thieves my favorite is the usual suspects verbal kint may not be reliable narrator but how the gang is put together combined with how they all are coerced to hijack the shipment is great coming up with plan not really heist movie but love the plan to steal rounding errors in office space logan lucky also was creative in what they were stealing and how they did it the sting is my favorite love it when plan comes together film so complex yet so simple place it on lucky dan the plan goes awry if you are willing to suspend all disbelief then pick mission impossible or fast and furious movie it is not the best way to deal with something going wrong but nothing tops the final bank heist in heat for me it masterfully shot feel incredibly real and intense one of my all time favorite scenes getting away could easily choose the usual suspects for this one too butch cassidy and sundance kid ending is iconic my favorite is denzel and clive owen in inside man,"The movie Inception has a creative way to steal from someone else's dream, and the movie Oceans shows off the talents of each crew member; The Town focuses on how friends work together and the plan in Logan Lucky is creative, and the complexity of The Sting is enjoyable. When things go wrong, the final bank heist in Heat is intense, and getting away is best depicted by Denzel and Clive Owen in Inside Man."
having only watched brandon cronenberg possessor before knew that the director has thing for weird and intriguing concepts and infinity pool was no exception it tells the story of james foster alexander skarsg rd an out of luck novelist who is on vacation to li tolqa to combat writer block there he meets gabi bauer mia goth and alban bauer jalil laspert things begin to go awry when james gets sentenced to death for hit and run case but he finds out that the fictional country allows him to create body double who will stand for him during execution which opens the door for body horror was completely mesmerized by the performance of mia goth while jalil laspert does well to accompany her he gets outshined by mia could not take my eyes off her the way she used privileged bratty tone and somehow made it scary was marvellous after seeing her in pearl have to keep my eye on her for future projects also liked the costume for the film if you looking for inspiration for next year halloween you know where to look for the creepy masks were disturbing but they somehow went with luxurious outfits worn by the rich while the script has some things to say about privilege the scare factor of the film is mixed bag it does sometimes manage to gross you out but at certain times it felt lazy as it was just using gross out moments to elicit reaction but failing to do so at the same time but the film was paced so well that many would not mind this slight blemish in the film,"You might want to avert your eyes for this one. Infinity Pool earns its title in more ways than one, because this vacationing horror movie is as enticing as it is repellent.
Interestingly, the repellent aspects mostly have to do with a privilege critique, and the ways the rich can buy their way out of anything, including justice. 

To wit, on vacation in Luxembourg, a novelist (Alexander Skarsgard) hits a boy with his car, an accident that leads to a bizarre and gruesome death sentence. 

Which allows him to create a stand-in. 

Or does it? 

This reviewer was mesmerized by Mia Goth's performance in this Brandon Cronenberg body-horror flick."
know it got exposed that the mnu were illegally experimenting but is wikus cleared of the accusations or do people and his wife still belive he had sex with the prawns also is there any other material out there to know more about the story like the aliens and their origin are so interesting really surprised we have not gotten sequel or prequel yet,"Wikus van der Merwe, protagonist of the 2004 film 'District 9', was exonerated of accusations that he sexually assaulted prawns, following exposure of the illegal experiments of the MNU. There is a wealth of information regarding the origin and biology of the alien species featured in the film, however there has yet to be a sequel or prequel to the movie."
was over at my parents house the other day and we started talking about scary movies that scared us the most as kid they both said exorcist and dawn of the dead then my dad asked me if remember being totally freaked out by water world had totally forgotten about that lol such random movie for whatever reason that movie gave little year old me nightmares for days after watched it still have not seen it to this day although should watch it just to laugh about how not scary it is does anyone else have movie like that,"Water World, for some reason, gave this user nightmares as a child. They have not seen it since, but their parents mentioned being scared by Exorcist and Dawn of the Dead as children. Perhaps this user should revisit Water World to laugh about how not scary it is."
was watching the first clerks movie last night and realized it was very similar to friday with chris tucker and ice cube ve been watching both movies for many years and only realized after last night the many similarities they have and think it was by pure coincidence because the time they were released apart each other was too close for friday to be similar by intention foreign films can be included but remakes and reboots do not count,"You may have noticed that the 1994 film Clerks, shares several similarities with the Friday starring Chris Tucker and Ice Cube (1995). Both movies share many of the same themes and plot elements, although they were released only a year apart. What do you think, were these similarities mere coincidence or intentional? Just to let you know, remakes and reboots aren't counts out of the realm of possibility here, so let your mind wander if you'd like, but ideally, we're looking for an opinion on the subject."
this movie popped in my head and wanted to show someone so went to show them the trailer it different movie based on the trailer the whole time telling them this isn the movie it way more subtle this feels like fast and furious or something was this just the style of all trailers from that period and don remember it or was this one particularly bad or am just dumb and the trailer was sick and represented the movie well,"You are questioning the accuracy of movie trailers in representing the actual movie accurately. Specifically, you mention how a trailer for a certain movie led you to believe it was something else entirely, perhaps resembling a Fast and Furious movie. You want to know if this is a common issue with movie trailers or if this particular trailer was misleading."

still relatively young and ve never worked job that paid sizable christmas bonus like you see in the film however the way he acts and everyone else reaction seems to imply he was expecting sizable amount so much so he mentioned people depended on it for their salary can anyone give me ballpark estimate of what was expected of his bonus at the time,"You're wondering what kind of bonus the main character could've expected, given the reactions of himself and his colleagues to the bonus amount they presumably received. 

Did you know that during the Great Depression, bonuses became a common phenomenon, as employers sought to incentivize workers to remain with their companies, oftentimes invoking religious undertones to portray their bonus offerings as acts of benevolence?

Sy develops photos for them for years, slowly trying to grow closer and imagining himself joining their family. On discovering their imperfections, Sy turns violent towards the family patriarch. The film never speaks Sy's motives, but it is clear he wants the happiness he never had. Through subtle clues, it is revealed that Sy was a victim of sexual abuse as a child, and the photos he develops for others are a way to escape his own horrific memories. The film is powerful and upsetting, handling intense themes with a subtlety that makes it all the more tragic."
what is the name of what happens in this movie if the daughter is fan of friends how does she not know that her mother appears in the series does this have name is it like breaking the fourth wall but in reverse sorry if this has name and do not know it the only example that remember is the case of bruce willis precisely in friends they saw die hard and did not recognize it,"You are describing a plot point commonly known as ""Fourth Wall Syndrome"". It refers to when a character in a movie or show is aware of their own fictional nature, or when a character knows something that the writers expect the audience to know, and yet the character remains ignorant. 

In the movie you're describing, it sounds like the daughter is a fan of the TV show Friends, and the mother played a guest role in one of the episodes. However, the daughter doesn't recognize her own mother on the show, despite the audience's awareness of her appearance. 

This plot point is often used for comedic effect and can create moments of meta-awareness and fun for the audience. Some other examples of this phenomenon include characters in the TV show The Office who make references to the documentary crew that films them (despite the fact that the characters themselves are unaware of the documentary), and the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, where the main character acknowledges the video game-like nature of his adventures."
beyonc brings fantastic choreographed show her lyrics to me are terrible but her music is deep and resonant taylor swift lexicon chord wise is stunted same four chords up and down the fretboard her lyrics are very good the difference in the movies for me was that beyonc tried to include we poor people into her life but since she always been pretty well off her woe is me attempts to inflict her family life onto us for hours seems like punishment but for sheer entertainment value liked her film more madonna movie was better than both,"In the writer's opinion, Beyonce has an amazing choreographed show with resonant music, despite weak lyrics. Taylor Swift has good lyrics but repetitive chords. In Beyonce's movie, she tries to include those less well-off, but since she comes from a wealthy background, it comes across as indulgent. Overall, the writer liked Madonna's movie better than Beyonce's."
few days ago watched the movie on netflix and to share my feeling about it disappointed because fassbender had the potential to play something more deep and more alive in fact it the first movie of him saw but by his face and build know there is something to do and even if it an interesting movie yes somehow disappointed tbh know it is the design and the approach of the killer and have nothing to retort do you have an opinion on this please,"You are disappointed with the movie you watched on Netflix featuring Fassbender. You think he could have portrayed his character with more depth and vitality. You also appreciate the detail put into the design of the killer in the film, but find the movie itself lacking.

one of my all time favorite christmas movies is the polar express it has great story great characters and very good message although most people really enjoy the movie one of the most consistently criticized aspects is the animation the film was the first movie to be made entirely with motion capture and since it was the first movie using this method of filmmaking many feel that this gave the animation an uncanny valley feeling it has become running joke to say that the movie looks creepy here the thing though watched the movie last night as part of my annual christmas movie marathon honestly do not think the animation looks very creepy sure the animation does look extremely realistic but also think that it adds in enough cartoonishness to make it not look creepy also considering that the film will be years old next year the animation has actually aged lot better then most other cgi animated movies from the era,"Although The Polar Express is beloved by many for its story and message, the film's animation is consistently criticized for its uncanny valley effect. However, the narrator doesn't find it creepy and thinks it has aged well compared to other CGI films from the same period."

this may seem like totally random question but every time watch movie or tv show people seem to have million table lights but never ceiling light at their apartment is it easier to film get the lighting right this way or something it especially weird when they come home from work and their billion table lights in room are already on or can you imagine having to turn off all these lights before going to bed leaving the room just something always notice and it bothering me edit so my conclusion is that it is apparently common thing not to have ceiling lights in the us call me shocked but ll put it to my list of cultural differences and for technical reasons during filming,"Every time you watch a movie or TV show, you always notice that the apartments always have a million table lights, but never ceiling lights. Why do sets never have ceiling lights? Is it easier to film this way? Or is this a common thing in the US?"

does anyone think shaun could have ended up regretting shooting barbara his mum in the head it means that when the situation is under control again she does not live on like ed did understand she would have changed lot unlike ed but surely that better than completely gone anyway what an amazing film really holds up,"The film 'Shaun of the Dead' features Shaun killing his mother Barbara by shooting her in the head to prevent her from becoming a zombie. Some viewers might contemplate whether Shaun would regret his decision, given Ed survived and changed post-zombie apocalypse, albeit contrasted with Barbara's fate of complete disappearance. Nevertheless, many admire the film for its compelling plot and lasting appeal."
some movies have very unique and weird animation scenes like mirrormask coraline james and the giant peach labrynth matrix etc sometimes it the intricate details the way the characters move the way it animated looking for some similar movie vibes do not know how to describe it fully but it just feels beautiful but weirded out at the same time kind of eerie but captivates your interest,"You might enjoy other movies that have distinctive animation styles and scenes that captivate audiences, such as MirrorMask, Coraline, James and the Giant Peach, Labyrinth and Matrix, which feature intricate details, unusual character movements and an eerie but captivating atmosphere."

why is movie theater attendance going down is it because of the convenience of online streaming is it because movies are worse than they used to be bad economy is it bad advertising are people not having fun at the movies anymore do you think that it is combination of the reasons have discussed,"There are several reasons why movie theater attendance is declining. Factors such as the convenience of online streaming services, an overall decrease in the quality of recent films, a poor economy, and inadequate advertising by theaters themselves likely all contribute to this trend. Another reason could be that people nowadays just aren't interested in going to the movies as they once were. It is likely a combination of these reasons, along with others, that theaters are losing attendance."

find daniel radcliffe to be an incredibly talented actor whether it the harry potter movies his comedic turn in al the yankovic story or his villainous role in the lost city he improved every movie he in however think people aren being entirely honest with themselves about his post harry potter career whenever someone brings up radcliffe there inevitably comment along the lines of radcliffe made bunch of money from harry potter and is now just making the weirdest stuff possible instead of chasing big projects this comment and this comment are good examples of that to an extent this is true he certainly been starring in many weird projects since harry potter however think there refusal to acknowledge that quality wise he hasn been able to attract work with lot of respected acclaimed directors hear many people compare radcliffe to pattinson but don find this comparison accurate pattinson has starred in unique interesting films such as the lighthouse good time high life and is even starring in bong joon ho next film through radcliffe career choices can be criticised for being predictable the quality of the work leaves lot to be desired movies like guns akimbo swiss army man escape from pretoria and victor frankenstein are received mixed to downright negative reception and he yet to attract the attention of directors on the caliber of robert eggers bong joon ho or the safdie brother people like to discuss radcliffe as an accomplished actor who made big bank and can now pick and choose his projects but don think he simply choosing not to work with yorgos lanthimos or robert eggers both of who produce incredibly weird experimental work but at higher level of quality than the directors radcliffe is working with to conclude this post think radcliffe is an immense talent but his body of work isn as accomplished as people make it appear to be what do you think,"Daniel Radcliffe is a very talented actor. Whether in the Harry Potter movies, his comedic roles, or in more villainous roles, he has proven his capability. However, since the Harry Potter franchise, people argue that he has only taken on projects for the paycheck, pursuing strange roles in strange movies. While Radcliffe has worked with notable directors, some people think he is capable of working with directors of even higher caliber, like Robert Eggers, Bong Joon Ho, or the Safdie brothers.  Overall, people think Radcliffe is a great actor, but he has not yet achieved the level of accomplishment post-Harry Potter that people claim him to have."

just gonna ask it was that green eyed girl satan that what was thinking the whole time since it obvious she had some sort of power and her eyes were glowing also did not she float twice once down stairway or was she just sliding down the rail and another down from the nd floor of the cult place and why is she such good fighter and athletic she looked like she was barely even trying to beat up that black guy just dunno why her identity was never revealed and why she knew everything where the last page was too okay so who was she slightly unrelated another theory people say is corso is satan finding his way back to his kingdom so corso is satan supposedly which means the girl is not which would make her his guardian angel demoness,"You are wondering who the mysterious green-eyed girl is and if she is connected to Satan.

calling the motion capture adaptation of christmas carol divisive would be an understatement some consider it to be one of the best adaptations while others consider it to be one of the worst as for me am firmly on team there are things it does well and things that could use some work however there is actually subtle bit of brilliance to the film throughout the film there are numerous actors who play multiple roles however the roles they play are not random each actor who plays two or more roles play roles that either connect to or contrast with each other scrooge experiences with each ghost are tied to the life that he led as such jim carrey plays scrooge the ghost of christmas past the ghost of christmas present and the ghost of christmas future he only provided the motion capture for the ghost of the future since the ghost does not actually speak jacob marley and bob crachit both work with scrooge but directly contrast one another marley was scrooge corrupt original partner while crachit is kind hearted clerk who in this adaptation actually becomes scrooge partner after scrooge becomes redeemed both characters are played by gary oldman scrooge sister fan and his former love belle are both played by robin wright not only are they the two most important women in scrooge life but he lost both under tragic circumstances in the past we meet jolly and kind mr fezziwig played by the late great bob hoskins in the future we see the greedy old joe ll give you three guesses as to who plays him,"Many actors play multiple roles in this version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" but they are not random--each role pairs with or contrasts another, reflecting themes in Scrooge's life. Jim Carrey plays Scrooge as well as the three ghosts who show him his past, present, and future. Gary Oldman plays two contrasting characters who work with Scrooge. And Robin Wright plays Scrooge's lost love and sister."
just part of discussion its been weeks now and many of you guys have watched movie animal there was scene where ranveer explains about concept of women choosing right men for them alpha men who were strong and could protect them and their children from any danger or harm that could possibly arise and then he explains about other non alpha men who have the urge and need too but are not as strong as alpha men so the concept of poetry arrised in form of love what your specific thought on that particular dialogues and scene feel free to share your thought,"You are discussing a movie called Animal and the dialogue where Ranveer explains the difference between alpha men and non-alpha men. Alpha men are strong and protective while non-alpha men might not be as strong, so women need poetry (i.e. love) to be attracted to them. What are your thoughts about this concept?"
rewatched it today for the first time since aside from somewhat formulaic script it fantastic film what astounded me most was the groundbreaking cgi you could tell someone that it released this year and they would likely believe you eat your heart out marvel the scene where caesar spoke for the first time gave me chills can only imagine where the sequels go from here think it safe to say that am rooting for the ape uprising haha unsure how these films did commercially but surprised don hear them discussed more much better than any other hollywood blockbuster ve seen in long time edit just finished dawn of the planet of the apes and hot damn that was incredible it subverted expectations and looked phenomenal doing it so happy that fourth installment is releasing in just great movies all around,"The user is amazed at the CGI of the Planet of the Apes franchise and is excited for the upcoming movie, enjoying it more than other blockbusters they've seen recently. They particularly enjoyed Caesar's performance in the first movie and were surprised by the subversion of expectations in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.

randomly thought about it my husband is from an abusive family crazy abusive mom drug addicted dad that always drunk never had steady home didn have any friend due to frequent change of schools believe it or not he watched top gun and completely obsessed with it neither of his parents care what he did after high school graduate nobody offered him any guidance but because of his love to top gun he joined the air force he had pretty good time found hobby met some friends stayed in europe for three years it changed his view to the world his love for top gun did continue he bought the same jacket and motorcycle he later got job started to have normal life his dad later became sober but only lived short life the rest of his family continued to be hot mess sometimes we joke that if it not for top gun his life would be lot different edit know know top gun is not about the air force it was all about flying planes for him at that time plus air force was the one went to his school to recruit,"Due to her husband's abusive family, he didn't have any direction after graduating high school. However, his love for the movie Top Gun motivated him to join the Air Force, where he was able to find friends and a hobby. This experience changed his life and gave him direction."
this is very frustrating to me because this is my only big interest but still cannot use it in conversation something that is definitely related though is that do not really like to read reviews because do not see point in that guess not saying that reviews and film critics are useless but for me it like already feel certain way about film after watched it so hearing different opinion is not going to change that and if the author of review has similar opinion to mine then in the review they will probably accurately formulate thoughts that correspond to what think but in this case also what the point unless deliberately trying to teach myself the language needed to talk or write about film and the only case in which do usually read reviews is when watch some famous film do not get it at all and want to understand what people like about it perhaps should read literature about films that is anything other than reviews but just have not really gotten into that yet also not person to have strong opinions about anything so there that when try to think of something to say about film the only thing that conveys how feel about it is watching the film itself and everything else is just small insignificant details that are meaningless without all the context sure there are people who fell similarly and very curious to hear what you have to say about this as well as the perspective from people who are not like that,"You are frustrated that you cannot talk about film even though it is your big interest. You don't like to read reviews because you feel that you already have decided how you feel about a film after watching it, and a review won't change that. You also claim that you don't have strong opinions about things in general. You are interested in hearing about experiences of other people who also don't like to talk about films beyond watching them."
so me and my friend talking about years slave during the conversation said yeah it was also sad story for fassbender too if the time was different fassbender would have confess his feeling to nyongo instead of it came out middle of conversation about plot of the movie then the other friend instantly said that it weird to refer character using actor name understand the scene depicted was pretty violent and awful and really felt weird after they pointed out want to hear other people opinion about this,"You and your friend were discussing the movie '12 Years a Slave' and remarked on how the story was also sad for actor Michael Fassbender, because in a different reality, if the circumstances were different, Fassbender could have confessed his feelings to Lupita Nyong'o instead of discussing the plot of the movie. Your other friend found it strange to mention the actor's name while discussing the character's feelings, especially since the scene they were talking about was violent and awful. You are wondering what other people think about this."
park has worked as movie critic before becoming director recently during criterion closet pick interview video he mentioned he has written articles on don spiegel and it got me thinking is there any way to access his work during his critic days as far as know doing general google search does not fetch any results about him so would love to know if is there any possible way to look into his movie critic work,"You might want to look into whether he wrote under a pseudonym, or whether those articles were published in outlets that do not have an online presence, or have since been taken down or moved. It might also be worth looking into whether he has discussed his past criticism in any interviews (beyond the one you mention), as well as whether any movie databases or criticism archives have indexed his work."
she should somewhat take responsibility considering the fact she went on her phone for split second but the problem is the guy backing up in the middle of the road regardless of her paying attention or not there would still be crash maybe not as fatal if she stepped on the break still causing collision,"Although the woman on her phone is partially responsible for not paying attention, the driver behind her is also responsible for not driving attentively and crashing into her car despite her attempting to brake to avoid the collision."
something similar to good time already seen uncut gems will be watching next apprenticeship of duddy kravitz looking for premise of character who is introduced as broke or very quickly goes into debt and resorts to small scale petty crime please refrain from films where the scheme becomes large scale operations local authorities should be the extent of the law influence in the film,"Looking for a movie where the main character, after a quick descent into poverty, dabbles in small-scale crime, perhaps engaging in schemes that skirt, but don't attract the attention of local authorities. Preferably something along the lines of Good Time and Uncut Gems. You might enjoy the 1998 coming-of-age comedy-drama The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz."
the one always think of is in rookie of the year when the manager tells chet gary busey he going to take him out chet goes give me one more the manager says no and chet goes give me one more and you can see in his eyes that he knows he at the end he hurting but he wants that last chance to say goodbye to the sport he loves silly little comedy but busey tapped into some acting chops for that line,"Rookie of the Year features a memorable scene where Chet, played by Gary Busey, begs his manager for ""one more"" chance to play baseball. Despite the manager's refusal, Chet persists, illustrating his love for the sport. This moment showcases Busey's acting abilities and the emotional depth he brought to the character."
movies where your initial opinion is in total contrast from when you first saw it vs your rewatch maybe you hated it then loved it or loved then hated it or maybe you really liked it then felt bewildered why you bestowed such praise upon it sometimes these are childhood picks but most fascinated when it during your adult years and something just changes here one of mine captain fantastic with viggo mortensen saw it on rental when it came out was taken lot by it to the extent that would ve had it in my top of the year funny moving great turns from everyone watched again few years later in early so many key pieces suddenly did not ring truthfully to me or just did not land at all did not connect with it like had the first time so throw down your picks in here and let discuss,"Sometimes our opinions on movies change from when we first saw them to when we re-watched them. Examples include hating a movie at first but loving it upon a rewatch, or vice-versa. Or maybe liking a movie initially but not understanding why after a rewatch. This can happen with childhood movies, but more often it happens with movies we watch as adults. 

One example is Captain Fantastic, a movie that initially impressed the narrator so much that it made their top picks of the year. However, upon a rewatch a few years later, they didn't connect with it the same way and felt that many key elements did not ring true. 

Share your picks and discuss yours and the narrator's opinion on this topic."

here my film list of trippy psychedelic sexy human surrealism timestamped sequences ve created on letterboxd click read notes after visiting url or else it will not show the timestamped note entries made telling you when the sequence starts and ends in the film finding trippy sequences in film is time consuming but hoping you guys can help me find more trippy cool sequences footage from any film shorts even youtube videos but most importantly provide the timestamps of when the sequence begins and ends try to avoid content that is too abstract preferring sequences rooted in human related emotions feelings eroticism etc so tend to avoid films that show rock and abstract pattern for example in the movie neon demon created an entry in my list with this info neon demon scene blonde runway model enters different altered state of mind like another realm time when applicable suggest music you can play over the scene so you can watch esoterically outside the scope of the film original intended purpose skeptical just try it think of it like playing pink floyd over the wizard of oz or replace with your own music if you can suggest primo music that tends to go with any trippy sequence scene in film please share prefer music without vocals but some vocals is okay as long as it not coherent mainstream pop look forward to any trippy sequences you share from film including the timestamp of when the sequence begins and ends you can also comment on the letterboxd url provided up above image below is from the tv episode the viewing from cabinet of curiosities it will totally trip you out,"I have created a film list on the site Letterboxd containing trippy, psychedelic, sexy, and surreal sequences with timestamped notes.

have nothing but admiration for his acting and screen presence so sad to see him go after strong start in the and his career dwindled away paper moon and what up doc will always be rewatchable to me but doubt love story has aged well did he do any others that are recommended,"Gene Wilder was a brilliant comedic actor, with a formidable screen presence and impeccable comedic timing. Even though his career saw a decline in later years, he'll always be loved for his roles in ""Paper Moon"" and ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory""."
there so many of them it hard to wade through them to find the ones most worth watching there some that are pretty decent it would be good to know which ones you guys liked the most an example would be christmas inheritance not shakespeare but decent story and performances even if you don like this particular one any others you liked,"There are many movies to watch and it is challenging to filter out the good ones. Christmas Inheritance is one that is decently made with a good story and performances, although it may not be to your taste."
it may have started before but from my perspective it seems like it was response to man of steel ever since then wether it the mcu dc monsterverse or any sort of action adventure that is aimed towards teen young adult audience any sort of big battle always have to start with someone saying we where able to evacuate the area or this area has been abandoned for decades was just rewatching godzilla vs kong and when kong picks up jet to chuck at godzilla ofc they show us the pilot ejecting before the crash is it really that bad to see some people die in your big monster battle like sure bunch of people died when they destroyed the aircraft carriers but thats just ignored not sure if wording this correctly do not need pg action movie to be bloodbath but it takes me out of the movies when the only people we see die are people who are confirmed bad guys,"It has become a trend in recent action films, like those of the MCU and DC Monsterverse, to begin battles by stating that an area has been evacuated or abandoned, thus ensuring that no innocent bystanders will be harmed amidst the chaos of a monster battle. However, this trend removes stakes from the action and takes the viewer out of the film when collateral damage is avoided altogether."
got into discussion of movie trilogies where all movies were commercial and critical successes and could only come up with few for the purpose of the discussion there can be more movies in the series but the have to be in row star wars for example could only come up with few others indiana jones lotr back to the future toy story we brought up alien terminator predator but there weren strong ones in row granted opinion will make difference but can anyone give me others,"It can be challenging to think of movie trilogies with critical and commercial successes that continue over a series of three or more films. Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings, and Back to the Future are examples of franchises that have achieved this so far. While the Alien and Terminator series both have sequels, their follow-ups haven't been as well-received as the original films, making it difficult to continue a trilogy. Perhaps the Predator series could continue and conclude with a third film to match the quality of the first two."
meaning you loved the movie and saw absolutely no faults in it when you were young but rewatched it more recently with more cynical lens and found holes in the story rewatched liar liar yesterday for the first time in its entirety since maybe when was having only seen bits and pieces on tv throughout the years between and now the magic that wore off for me was found one maybe two instances where he lied even though he could not tell lie supposedly one was when he was trying to write down that the color of the pen was red and he was threatening his arm saying write it or ll break it off this more seems like hollow threat rather than overt truth the second was when he was asked the question by his secretary if it was right if the burglar sued her friend and he said did not understand the question he clearly understood the question and said that as way to deflect responsibility for answering it the wrong way what movies did you rewatch recently maybe for the first time since you were kid and you either suddenly saw holes in its logic or the movie just was not as good as what you remember,"Recently I rewatched the movie Liar Liar for the first time since I was a kid. I remembered loving it as a kid, but on this recent viewing I could find holes in the story. I started to think maybe it wasn't as good as I remembered. Was there a movie you recently rewatched and found the same thing?"
with streaming and covid changing moviegoing habits and certain genres struggling in theaters dramas comedies musicals would it be smart revive an old practice and start offering two films for the price of one audiences will like it because of the value theaters while annoyed at the long runtime it takes up will benefit from more concession sales at intermission and for studios it reduces the marketing you need on one film as the other film will be the main attraction it would also give an older film at the end of its run one more chance to make some bank the fact is most people pre order tickets for movies that are absolute must sees walk ups aren really thing anymore films that illicit mild curiosity among the public get will wait till streaming reaction from most if studio bundles two mild curiosity films together that how you can get people to pull the trigger,"People are changing their moviegoing habits because of streaming and COVID-19, and theaters are searching for new ways to entice audiences. One solution is to offer a discount ticket price for two films, creating more value for the audience while also increasing sales of concessions during intermissions. For studios, it means they would have to market fewer blockbusters each year, as one of the films in the double feature would be the main attraction, and it would give older films one more chance to find an audience."
since around the retrowave music genre gained popularity and in its tail lights new movie genre also emerged retrowave cinema the movie genre focuses on the colorful neon lit aesthetics of movies and synthesizer soundtracks and love it examples of prominent movies within the genre are drive maniac the guest it follows turbo kid kung fury hot summer nights summer commando ninja kate fear street terrifier most of the movies are pretty low budget but they somehow turn out excellent anyways currently few more interesting entries are on their way commando ninja ii terrifier and kung fury the movie the most popular example of the genre is of cause the stranger things series but do you think the genre is here to stay which are your favorite retrowave movies,"Retrowave cinema is a movie genre that emerged alongside the synthwave music genre.

Do you think Retrowave cinema is here to stay? Which are some of your favorite movies from this genre?"

need recommendation for movie where the main theme is that the protagonist thinks that they are metaphorically or literally monster out of control possessed by their demons and therefore unsafe to be around others and unworthy of love and by the end of it they figure out that no they have control over themselves that their fear of hurting others was itself the evidence that they are good and trustworthy person and that they have self control cerebral dramas preferred paranormal and or queer is plus trying to steer away from horror and hallmark movie one dimensional romance edit think more looking for the message of the hulk ie boy fear of puberty turning them into rage filled beast that might accidentally hurt someone they love but not big budget action movie shrek and megamind are more about internalizing the external messages about badness whereas the hulk is an internally generated fear of self,"I'm looking for movie recommendations where the protagonist is worried they are a monster and unsafe to be around others, but by the end of the movie they realize they have control over themselves and do not deserve the label of monster. The movie has to have a positive message about self-control and not give into fears or external pressures. Preferably it would be paranormal or queer-themed and steer away from horror and typical romance movies."
known about this movie ever since was kid but had no idea what it was about other than cafe in the desert the editing was extremely strange with flashes and quick cuts to other scenes the characters were strange almost couldn believe that jack palance would play character like that mainly remember him from batman and city slickers marianne gebrecht was real treat and of course cch pounder is always great liked the small cast it almost reminded me of how felt watching the cast of northern exposure honestly found this movie to be more genuinely quirky than any wes anderson film glad finally got around to watching it but feel it definitely one time viewing what did you all think of it,"The movie is set in a cafe in the desert and revolves around strange characters portrayed by Jack Palance, Marianne Gebrecht and CCH Pounder amongst others. The editing is quirky with strange cuts and flashes. The movie is reminiscent of Northern Exposure in its tone and style."
as title reads like to find good movies that are set in the soviet union for some reason have bit of thing for commieblock history have seen the death of stalin and recently watched the new tetris movie both of which enjoyed as an example for roughly what im after does not have to be based on true stories like those two movies are although with alot of tweaks for comedy and general watchability fiction is completely fine aswell,"You should watch 'The Death of Stalin' and 'Tetris.'

in all my years ve enjoyed the super bowl timeframe because it when studios usually release their teasers for the upcoming summer it also time when laugh at studios throwing money behind movies that know are going to be terrible the last one remember laughing at was abraham lincoln vampire hunter can you think of anything else eta wow what toxic community,The Super Bowl time frame is enjoyable for the trailers and commercials that studios release for upcoming movies. The commentator recalls enjoying laughter at the failure of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter and wonders what other failures will be teased then.
have experienced this many times in my life but never really noticed it until recently because have not had cable the past half decade was watching movie on cable and there was scene with dialogue that had several moments of silence but you could hear the white noise coming through the tv very loudly it was not just things happening in the background although you could hear that plates dishes light chatter but dominating everything else was this almost soothing white noise that faded out noticeably when it cut to commercial remember hearing this on countless movies watched on tv as child and remember the white noise being quite soothing and putting me to sleep often times the moments where it switched to commercial and the white noise faded out were quite nostalgic do not recall ever hearing this on show am streaming or watching on physical copy in fact was so curious about this that purchased rental of the same movie from amazon and fast forwarded to the part that had this noise on cable sure enough the noise was not there there is something about cable television or the channels themselves that must alter the audio to create these sounds curious if anyone else has experienced or noticed this or if anyone has an explanation of why this may occur,"Have you ever noticed that when you watch a movie on cable, there is often a strange, almost white noise sound audible in the background? I noticed this recently when watching a movie on cable, and it made me nostalgic. I fast-forwarded to the part on my Amazon rental and the noise was gone. What gives? Why does cable TV alter audio in this way?"
this is how it works you have movies in your world cup that you choose to watch from your home my dad picks the movies for me through seeing what on streaming platforms like netflix amazon or disney once the movies have been picked we number them put their numbers in bowl with little teared piece of paper then group them into four groups of by whichever movies are picked out for that group then whichever movie pick out the one going to watch this do every time before watch movie in the world cup not based on the one want to watch the most this is the one doing now what do you think group parasite the whale heat rogue agent group airplane quadrophenia mr and mrs smith the pink panther group schlindlers list inglorious bastards the killer the silence of the lambs group angry men the full monty gran torino brave heart currently angry men is winning ve seen everything except parasite,"You have a movie tournament you watch one movie at a time at home.

hi all apologies if this isn the place to ask but going out of my mind there thing going around to name what you think of when you see vhs tape for me it double bill of freaky friday and the muncies but can say that because not single person has ever heard of the muncies and have been trying to find it on google for at least decade and can there every possibility have the name wrong but can find it as synopsis either it terrible film from the where wealthy old lady leaves her entire inheritance to her dippy blonde maid who then moves her hillbilly family in and all her ex colleagues are now waiting on her it is terrible film but it is also my childhood and appreciate anyone who can help find my childhood please thank you,"The name of a VHS tape from the customer's childhood is ""The Muncies"" but they can't find any information about the movie online and are wondering if they are remembering the name wrong. They recall snippets of the plot involving a wealthy woman, a dippy maid, and her hillbilly family."
as the title says this is going to be battle between two great if not the most iconic movies about the vietnam war where apocalypse now tries to show bigger picture of the war trying to include every aspect platoon keeps it small but very intimate and shows the madness of one single group really could not pick favorite so thought it would be fun to make this battle would love to hear which one you guys pick and why,"Battle of the Movies: Platoon vs. Apocalypse Now

Two iconic films depicting the Vietnam War, Apocalypse Now portrays the war's broader context and themes, while Platoon offers a more intimate look at the madness of one platoon. Unable to choose a favorite, this battle compares both movies' storylines, themes and uniqueness. Which film do you prefer? Share your thoughts and reasons."
recall watching nancy meyers the holiday back around the time of release and just thinking it was ok and maybe bit long rewatched it last night and thought it was brilliant cameron diaz performance was especially great think it the fact that the cheap hallmark xmas movies which also enjoy just don have the extremely good writing this movie has or perhaps we are just starved for exceptionally well constructed big budget rom coms these days did some googling and this movie is on its way to becoming cult film so enjoying it now is not entirely original but anyone else revisited movie and enjoyed it lot more,"I recently re-watched 'The Holiday', which I thought was just okay when I first saw it in theatres years ago. I was really impressed this time around, especially with Cameron Diaz's performance. I think it's because the writing in this film is much better than in cheap Christmas movies, or maybe it's just that we don't get many well-made big-budget romantic comedies like this one anymore. It's interesting that this movie is becoming a cult classic because it's more enjoyable to re-watch now that it's not as new."
just like it says can go first best black christmas one of the og slashers and just excellent all around great cast great story setting ending is perfect imho worst letters to satan is almost unwatchable but have to award worst to silent night with malcolm mcdowell and jaime king she also in hallmark christmas movies which is hilarious despite good actors and an interesting story and santa with flamethrower it goes off the rails ve read it was trying to be remake of classic original silent night deadly night but it really just goes off the rails let just say that there scene with wood chipper and topless hooker that isn even the worst scene in the movie could ve been good or at least campy like santa slay which opens weirdly with some somewhat big name cameos which isn trying to be anything it not,"Best: ""Black Christmas"" is an excellent slasher film with a great cast, story, and ending. Worst: ""Letters to Satan"" is nearly unwatchable, but ""Silent Night"" with Malcolm McDowell and Jaime King is a close second, trying and failing to recreate the campy charm of ""Silent Night, Deadly Night."" 

Would you like me to help you with anything else regarding film reviews?"
very underrated performance yet the movie is widely regarded as one of the best movies ever also it would not have been crime to give robert patrick the best supporting actor oscar many people say that oh arnie has only that one face impression the whole movie etc but basically that the point and there is lot more how he performs that role easily the best performance by arnold and this performance should definitely be more appraised total perfection from start to finnish by arnold,"Many people overlook Arnold Schwarzenegger's excellent performance in the movie ""The Terminator"" (1984). Arnold is believed by many to have a limited range of expressions, but his stoic and deadly performance is the core of why ""The Terminator"" is a classic and universally revered movie. Additionally, many feel that Robert Patrick's performance as the T-1000 was robbed of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor."
was wondering what your guys take on the dude line from the beginning of the movie when he first touring the other lebowski house and is introduced to the german guy who lying in the pool and someone goes he nihilist and the dude quips back how exhausting does he say that because the guy is lying around or because it must be exhausting to hate everything all the time,"In the movie The Big Lebowski, the Dude makes a comment about how exhausting it must be for a person to constantly refer to themselves as a nihilist when introduced to a new character who lays in a pool and declares himself a nihilist. The Dude wonders if it is exhausting because the person hates everything or because it is tedious to state one's outlook on life so readily."
this might be dumb question but why did neil abandon eady at the end did he do it to protect eady and not get her in trouble in potential shoot out or did he just simply take his own advice and abandoned her for his own sake to give himself better chance to escape and would not he have better chance escaping with the car there love the movie but was just little confused about that scene edit feel like lot of people did not understand my question and perhaps worded it incorrectly know about neil no attachement code my question was more about did he really leave her for the sake of his code like was that selfish act or did he do it for her safety and to keep her away from trouble or both,"You are wondering whether Neil left Emily at the restaurant, at the end of the movie, Nocturnal Animals, to protect her or for his own selfish reasons. 

Would you like me to provide a plot summary of the film? Alternatively, I can list the reasons why Neil may have abandoned Emily."
just tried watching disney christmas carol for the first time since read it was close to the original dickens classic in story and dialogue it was good not great but kept getting removed from the story because of the odd camera angles and way the scenes played out then looked up it was released in for and pitched as movie for theatres knew something was up because watching it now made it seem very gimmicky and strange when trying to watch it in standard format to the flying scenes the objects coming at you or sitting right in front of you for lengths of time makes me wonder how many changes director or cinematographer will make just to use the aspect and how different movie would look if this was not at the forefront of development and shooting decisions when its being made,"Disney's A Christmas Carol, released in 2009, stays true to the original Dickens classic in terms of story and dialogue. However, the movie feels gimmicky and strange in parts due to its odd camera angles and scene transitions, likely a result of it being designed for theatrical release. Watching this movie made me wonder how much a movie's development and shooting decisions would differ if theater-specific aspects weren't a priority."

was stuck on the price tag at the end of the movie for an individual toy david cross character said ran the inflation calculator and that what the market for these things keep in mind this is nintendo is popular playstation is out kids have plenty of shows to watch on cable if they want to toys are still thing but asking parent to cough up that amount is lot plus it set there are gorgonites and commando elite that total of at the time and in money where are they selling these things anyways obviously the shop where alan worked was not the intention also is alan moron he selling high price novelty toys in some random local toy shop where you can buy plushy for huh oh it and gets stupider later in the movie when chip hazard attacks that building to get more toys there is whole heap of them why is there so much supply and again who is the market for these things edit also these toys are brand new they are not from an established television show or movie the advertising has to start from scratch what ceo would take risk like that oh yeah one played by denis leary,"The movie's ending shows the inflated price of the individual toys, making the market and demand questionable, especially when considering the supply abundance from the Gorgonites and Commando Elite sets. The plot gets dumber when Chip Hazard attacks the store to steal more toys, indicating the target market and supply chain for these unlicensed toys. The risks and factors involved in selling new, unlicensed toys are impractical and questionable."
am the only person that feels disappointed by the film this year watched matrix for the first time ever had went into it really excited but as it went on genuinely felt quite bored overall quite like films that take time to explain story and have lots of moments for character and relationship development but felt that all of those things were missing trinity personally did not see any lii on be between her and neo throughout the story and felt like her and neo moment at the end was just unnecessary overall her character just felt like she was there to add slightly more drama but felt like she could have not been there and the film still would go well with few tweaks morpheus think got the spelling completely wrong but oh well honestly didn see why he was so important for the audience to care about and couldn truly see why neo cared so much they had mentioned as recall the fact that they knew each other before the plot of the film but in the film morpheus just had to tell neo how to use all of his skills and that felt like the only real development between those two they had spent other scenes together but one on one development is the best method and that is what look for the other characters they felt like cannon fodder and waste of time to develop earlier on they needed some stakes to be there get but just felt cheated on when they were just slowly killed combat very controversial but it didn excite me not sure why but there we go neo being the one never truly got why neo was the one and started to think was missing parts of the film it is entirely possible that simply just had to pay more attention but it always confused me and distracted me from the plot ending had almost no interest in the weird sifi battle between the space ship things all the interest had was in the neo fight but get that it had dragged on bit personally overall feel like it is overrated and would like some other opinions the film just had very little stakes as felt the characters weren done justice despite reasonably good acting am sorry if my review dragged on but too long which is ironic considering my opinion of the matrix,"You wrote an opinionated review of the movie The Matrix expressing several criticisms. You felt that the characters were shallow and the story lacked development, diminishing the stakes of the plot. While you appreciate the acting, you overall feel that the movie is overrated and that there are elements that are boring and unnecessary."
huge fan of halo from until now have played every single entry to death especially the first which is my favorite game of all time ve finished the campaign at least times and don say it like really finished the campaign that much sometime after starting playing the game heard aliens was the main influence for the game from the aesthetic the spaces marines humor perfect dosage of horror adventure comedy enjoyment scare suspense action characters development characters alchemy vehicles floods its almost copy paste at this point so had to watch it to understand why it was influential to bungie and just hated it couldn be interested in anything thought everything looked dirty and the feel of everything felt depressing vasquez looked repulsive to me was young don judge me and couldn go past the first encounter with the xenomorphs and years later had rewatched the first alien and said to myself do yourself violence watched the nd again and what blast had it was amazing all the way through vasquez ended being my favorite with hicks understand now why they loved it and everything was there to make great game one of my favorite sci fi happy gave it second chance,"The writer is a huge fan of the Halo series, especially the first game. They mention that they originally disliked the Alien franchise because it seemed like the Halo series copied it, but they gave it another chance and appreciated it a lot more. They particularly enjoyed the combination of horror, comedy, and action, as well as the development of characters like Vasquez and Hicks."
cannot think of too many are there any other examples you can think of that stand out and would you say these are on point good the bad and the ugly revenge of the sith lotr return of the king not on this one though since fellowship was so charming it tough to nail the landing for trilogy with the nd often being the strongest think due to built up hype but not too much and maybe the freedom to do bit more knowing they can tidy wrap things up in the rd maybe studio interference plays part in the rd oftentimes being bit of dud as well,"It can be difficult for a sequel to live up to the expectations set by its predecessor. Sequel trilogy films like ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""The Return of the King"" are examples of successful sequels that managed to meet or even exceed the charm of the original films. However, the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy's ""The Two Towers"" is considered by some to be a weaker installment compared to the initially charming ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" Studio interference and built-up hype can put pressure on filmmakers, potentially affecting the quality of the final product."
so in the film three guys out on the town to have few drinks and potentially pick up some girls one of the guys meets girl named lilly who kept saying like you to him or repeated back any sentence that was said to her directly the girl was bit off and was pretty much fidgety and mindlessly staring at everyone anyways the guys score another girl and they all go back to their motel room to continue drinking and possibly having sex sadly the other girl passes out from too much alcohol and the guys still being horny decide to run train on lilly things start off normally but then lilly becomes aggressive and bites one of the male on their palm she then proceeds to viciously slash the other guy and drain him dry of his blood the guys panic and one of them grabs weapon to try and fight her but she overpowers and lunges at him proceed to drain him dry of his blood and ripped out his penis and balls in one fell swoop clint uses this chance to get out of the motel room but tumbles down flight of stairs which allows the female vampire to catch up to him she then gets on top of him still drenched in his friends blood and goes like you and then starts licking his shirt after few licks she stops and raises her head up and goes no like before moving away from him to sob in the corner clint then paces out through door by the staircase into an open space car park asking people for help the female vampire then morphs completely into her vampiric form and swoops down from the skies and takes him with her my question are as followed what is like you meant to be did she genuinely like this guy why did she turn him down after licking him few times was she planning on turning him is she going to kill him still after taking him up into the skies or is she going to turn him,"Lilly, a fidgety and awkward girl that one of the three guys meets at the bar repeats everything that is said to her. The guys take her back to their motel room along with another girl they met to drink and have sex. Lilly becomes aggressive and attacks one of the guys, draining him of his blood. She also overpowers another guy and rips out his genitalia. The now turned vampire tries to lure Clint, who escaped the room, into her trap by morphing into her vampire form and taking him to the skies. 

What does Clint do next?"
am gen wondering how violence in kids movies was allowed in the cause with this interview with don bluth he did back in may of this year he said that there was no one there to tell him that to not do this or that when making the secret of nimn guess this referred to violence huh was this normal back than cause wasn alive back than if anyone saw this please comment below,"You are wondering if there were rules about depicting violence in children's movies in the era when Don Bluth was making films, including The Secret of Nimh, and whether that influenced the amount of violence in his movies. You are specifically interested in feedback from people who are old enough to have seen movies from that time."
audrey had originated the role on broadway but miss caron nabbed the screen version audrey was the broadway gigi leslie was the movies gigi when audrey turned down the theatrical version the producers went with miss caron though born in france caron established her movie career in english language films so in her native country she is regarded more of as hollywood star than french movie star when she returned to france in the mid after her hollywood career had stalled she had trouble transitioning into french films because she was too american and ended up doing negligible tv projects definitely think audrey would have been better in gigi because leslie is so boring in that one at least audrey would have looked amazing on those cecil beaton dresses,"Though born in France, Miss Caron established herself as a movie actress in English language films and is regarded more as a Hollywood star than a French movie star. When she returned to her native country after her Hollywood career stalled, she had trouble transitioning to French films, and ended up doing TV projects. Many feel Audrey Hepburn would have been better cast as Gigi, feeling Leslie Caron was too boring in the role."
do not know what scarier the fact that everyone in the kingdom wants to run sword through my heart or that sometimes just wanna let em nimona it took me moment to gather my thoughts after watching netflix nimona my throat feels heavy and tight at the time of writing this review do not know how heartfelt movie like this flew under everyone radar nimona tells the tale of knight ballister boldheart riz ahmed who gets framed for the murder of queen valerin lorraine toussaint he teams up with shape shifter nimona chlo grace moretz to prove his innocence to the world this movie is one of the most important films made this year considering the geo political climate the film expertly tackles themes of fear mongering prejudice gender and racism without feeling forced am not going to give any spoilers but the ending is one of the saddest have seen in any animated film feel as if the shape shifting ability of nimona is commentary on how most of our boxes like race and gender are just societal constructs rather than being based on reality however do feel that some of the humour in the initial moments came as annoying but that is minor gripe in this emotional roller coaster of film the emotional quotient of the film gets increased because of the performances of riz ahmed and chlo grace moretz they share wholesome chemistry so when things go awry you feel awful for the characters was left complete mess by the end of the film even the animation style of the film is top notch there is feel of cyberpunk present in the film which is perfect for the futuristic setting of the film it also manages to generate emotions within the audience the character designs were immaculate making every character distinct in appearance,"Nimona is a movie that tackles themes of fear-mongering, prejudice, gender, and racism. It skillfully weaves these themes into a tale of a knight and shapeshifter who must prove his innocence. The movie culminates in a sad yet poignant ending. The animation is top-notch and generates emotion from the audience. The characters are well designed and stand out. Despite minor complaints about the humor, Nimona is a worthwhile film due to its important messages and emotional rollercoaster."
when think of hitchcock movies my two favorites are vertigo and psycho know that vertigo has become critical darling over the years but love the film because it is hitchcock most visually evocative and emotionally involving work psycho speaks for itself also love notorious north by northwest and strangers on train what is your favorite hitchcock movie,"You love Alfred Hitchcock's movies, particularly Psycho, Vertigo, North by Northwest and Strangers on a Train.

need two movies that highlight this difference between them ve found this explanations witches tend to specialize in herbalism divination such as tarot readings and spellcasting sorceresses generally have more of an affinity for magical objects such as talismans and amulets prophetic visions astral projection and creating incantations that summon spirits,"Here are two movies that illustrate the differences between witches and sorceresses: *The Witch* (2015) and *Practical Magic* (1998).

there countless to mention only counting the real stunt no cgi thinking back and researching the ones remember would have to say it would be the pre credit opening scene in the spy who loved me when bond is getting chased while on skis as the close the gap there only oneway jumping off cliff as he jumps there long drop that seems like forever as he free falls it totally silent he kicks his skis off and what feels like forever finally opens his parachute giant british flag then the classic bond theme as he descends honourable mention the opening of goldeneye when he jumping off the dam imo rehash of the the spy who loved me same watching him free fall as everything is silent know there probably dozens of better stunts but this is the first one which came to mind opinions the one other one that comes to mind think not it might be in live and let die the car chase where he does full twist jump over the water and lands on all probably wrong on something here,"There are many stunts to choose from in the Bond films, and it can be difficult to select just one. However, the pre-credit opening scene in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" stands out for its long free fall followed by a silent parachute deployment high above the ground. Another notable stunt is Bond's full twist jump in a car chase scene in ""Live and Let Die."" 

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding James Bond films?"

what are some films from the last years that gained massive critical acclaim that either have not aged well or do not hold up on repeat viewings will start with get out on first viewing thought it was solid horror film but also felt that it was metaphor for the slavery that african americans were subjected to for hundreds of years and also depiction of covert or subtle racism that exists widely today so thought it was pretty impressive and relevant and great flick mainly for the latter reasons unfortunately the caveat to that is once viewed it second time about years later knowing what it message is already it really was not that good because now it just horror film and only decent one not great one,"Get Out is a decent horror film, but after second viewing it feels somewhat lacking once the powerful message about racism is taken out of the equation. Other films that fit this description of having poor re-watch value or not aging well include: Requiem for a Dream, Mother!, and Manchester by the Sea."
hey fellow movie enthusiasts ve always been fascinated by stories that showcase the journey of characters who initially chase honor righteousness or the greater good but find themselves stumbling along the way they are driven too much by greed or in general something that is against common norms however despite their failures and setbacks they somehow manage to rise again ultimately achieving true or even greater honor find these story arcs to be incredibly inspiring and would love to hear your recommendations for movies or series that portray such characters thanks in advance examples the last samurai in this film captain nathan algren disillusioned former soldier initially falls from honor due to his involvement in the atrocities committed against indigenous people through his time spent with the samurai and embracing their values algren finds redemption and rises to honor by fighting alongside them against oppressive forces jorah mormont from game of thrones jorah starts off as an exiled knight desperate to regain his honor and the love of his queen however he allows his misguided pursuit of honor to lead him down path of betrayal and loss yet through immense personal growth and self reflection jorah eventually discovers truer version of honor and becomes loyal protector and advisor redeeming himself in the process bruce wayne batman the dark knight trilogy bruce wayne starts his journey as batman driven by revenge and darkness however through his encounters with allies and foes he learns to rely on hope justice and sacrifices ultimately embracing his role as gotham protector and symbol of honor logan wolverine logan logan plagued by violent past battles with his animalistic nature and past failures through his relationship with young mutant he finds redemption and chance to protect and guide the next generation of heroes ultimately sacrificing himself for their survival breaking bad showcases this development in the journey of walter white high school chemistry teacher turned ruthless drug lord walter starts with fall from grace succumbing to his own moral shortcomings as he descends into the criminal underworld however as the series progresses he seeks redemption and ultimately sacrifices himself to protect his family and rectify his wrongdoings,"You are interested in stories where characters start off chasing honor, but end up losing their way due to greed or personal shortcomings, but eventually find redemption and a new understanding of honor.

peak steve martin and eddie murphy but for me the way that movie takes the weird realities of hollywood and packages as this hilarious farce makes it all the more funnier any one of those outlandish characters in the movie could be real life hollywood stars and we all know which ones for me christine baranski character just takes the cake each character has such quotable lines and the ability of this movie to make up totally new words and sentences just always makes me laugh chubby rain mind head why you say alien love must get my umbrella inhale my gonads,"Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy's comedic chemistry in ""Bowfinger"" makes the farce about an unsuccessful filmmaker preparing for his first big movie even more enjoyable.

although crash was generally well recieved the main reason people talk about it nowadays is that fact that it infamously won best picture against capote brokeback mountain good night and good luck and

the decision to have white actors wear yellowface alice through the looking glass the sequel to tim burton film alice in wonderland is largely known for two things being the final film of the late great alan rickman and for coming out around the same time that johnny depp who plays the mad hatter in the movie was going through messy divorce with amber heard not helping matters was the fact that heard accused depp of domestic abuse mere week before the movie was released gangster squad flew relatively below the radar however most discussion about the movie is in regards to the fact that it needed to be reshot to remove movie theater shooutout following the aurora theater shooting in addition to being known for being one of the first movies in the found footage sub genre cannibal holocaust is also infamous for being so convincing that the director actually had to have the actors in the film appear in court merely to prove that he had not killed them for the sake of the movie although breakfast at tiffany has many fans it hard to not talk about mickey rooney infamous performance as the asian stereotype character mr yunioshi it so infamous that many people involved in the film have apologized for it the premiere of melancholia was overshadowed by lars von trier infamous interview where he said that he empathized with the nazis nowadays the english patient is known for being mocked in an episode of seinfeld and stealing the best picture oscar from fargo the island of dr moreau is more famous for it troubled production then the actual content of the film there is even documentary about it although taxi driver is good enough to stand on it own merits it will likely forever be linked to the attempted assassination of ronald reagen since john hinkley committed the act in an attempt to impress jodie foster who is notorious for refusing to talk about the incident in addition to being notorious for just being really crappy movie the netflix death note movie is also infamous for the decision to not only change the location from japan to america but also to have white actors play the previously asian roles although ralph bakshi coonskin is cult classic like

ironically critics and black people have praised the movie for being extremely anti racist when it was originally released white wilderness was critical success and even won the academy award for best documentary feature nowadays it impossible to talk about the movie without bringing up the fact that the production crew forced lemmings off cliff to perpetuate the myth that lemmings are suicidal it almost impossible to talk about twilight zone the movie without bringing up the helicopter crash that resulted in the deaths of vic morrow and two child actors adding fuel to the fire was the fact that both child actors were illegally employed and john landis the director of the segment in question being acquitted of manslaughter pan was box office bomb and would likely have been forgotten if

lisa bonet getting fired from the cosby show due to her filming sex scene when mohammad messanger of god was announced it was rumored that the film was actually going to depict the prophet something that most people know is one of the biggest no nos in the history of history this led to outcry from muslims including protests and even terrorist attack the film does not actually portray the prophet on screen but the damage was done whenever natural born killers gets talked about it mostly in regards to the various real life copycats that it inspired this in spite of the fact that the film makes it pretty clear that you are not supposed to be rooting for the main characters song of the south was very well received when it originally came out and even won the academy award for best original

as award season discussion ramps up ve seen more and more the idea that the feminist theory on display in barbie is too simplistic or dumbed down rather than disagree with this viewpoint think that greta gerwig made very deliberate decision to pitch the film at an introductory level this is movie that little girls are going to want to watch for long time sure most people seeing barbie in theaters earlier this year would have noticed the girls in attendance for thousands and thousands of girls and boys it will be first introduction to feminist principles which is why primer is more valuable choice than bleeding edge current theory it is jumping off point for an ongoing journey not an endpoint in years time confident that this movie will be beloved by new generation that have grown up with it holding similar place of affection that movie like say league of their own does now it is to be applauded that gerwig has made movie that think both works today and will grow in stature with time incidentally this is also the reason think the america ferrera monologue was the correct choice while it is somewhat heavy handed for an adult audience for younger ears being explicit with your meaning is not bad idea gerwig knew making movie with the barbie ip was rare opportunity to make an unprecedented feminist trojan horse and she swung for the fences,"The Barbie movie's feminist theory is simple, but it was a deliberate decision by Greta Gerwig to make it that way. This movie is supposed to be an introduction to feminist principles for many young girls attending the movie, so it is pitched at a basic level. In time, Gerwig hopes that this movie will be loved by the new generation alike some other famous movies with feminist themes. 

This simplicity is also the reason why America Ferrera's monologue was included in the movie, as younger audiences can benefit from being explicit about these ideas. Greta Gerwig aims to use the Barbie IP to introduce feminist concepts to a new generation, and the movie aims to do so in a way that will leave a lasting impression."
sure there are plenty of us who were so impressed with how movie was that we re so eager to show it to our family and friends that you hope will be as hooked in the experience as you are sometimes you succeed in getting them to be as interested but has there ever been time where you introduced movie to person you thought would like it as much as you did but by the end they just did not find it that entertaining and were either underwhelmed by how much you overhyped it or they just did feel invested enough to really care about what was going on how did you feel after they gave their opinion and did it leave you disappointed,"You are excited to share with friends and family movies you love, but sometimes they don't have the same enthusiasm. They may feel underwhelmed if you exaggerated how good the movie is, or they might just not care enough about the plot or characters. What does it feel like when your movie recommendation fails?"
what the title says whether it has made you angry from how underwhelming it was the skill of the director for making you feel something or just anything along those lines there two that immediately come to mind for me eden lake and the open house but ll try to think of couple more positive eden lake great and very tense film with an ending that is just brutal emotionally funny games very similar reasoning to eden lake incredibly bleak movie negative the open house easily one of the worst films ve ever seen in my life period so much set up with absolutely no pay off had me pissed off it chapter two loved the first chapter thought it was fantastic blend of childhood wonder and horror this one however awful everything was weak from performances to attempts at comedy to the finale not for me bucky larson form of torture,"The customer is disappointed in the movies Eden Lake and The Open House for being underwhelming and badly made and failing to elicit any emotions from the viewer. The customer did, however, enjoy the first chapter of the movie ""Chapter Two"" but did not like the sequel."

hero and villain used loosely here do not bitch about well ackshually he not the hero so know lot of people including myself have an issue with the whole not gonna kill you because then ll be just like you shit that the hero spews in order to justify sparing the final boss after having just killed every henchman in his way it such played out trope that hollywood seems to not want to let go of it the cheapest and most unearned way of making the hero sympathetic legit feels like remnant of the hays code meanwhile it so awesome to see endings like icario jesse tells walt to do it himself,"Many people, including the speaker, are frustrated with heroes who opt not to kill villains out of moral justification when it is convenient for the story. This is contrasted with villains who are killed without a moment's hesitation, and the speaker prefers more nuanced and interesting endings, like the one in ""Icarus""."
ie aliens the fugitive marshals twister aliens team were the best at what they do and rolled with that confidence ifykyk fugitive went to great lengths to give added dimension to tommy lee team they were professionals and getting the bad guy while also surviving mattered they were not superheroes but professionals involved with intense work authorities were often one note chasers until then that the plot dispelled with to put priority on the chase gerard remorse for newman after getting the drop on copeland and temporarily deafening his subordinate was neat addition to that scene that so many other movies would just omit or gloss over the team dynamic was so strong that they got sequel sans ford twister also had great team dynamics and showed how everyone brought something unique to the table love phillip seymour hoffman as dustin davis in this one because his character is having fun and loves the chase and being with the team he also is lot of fun in along came polly and stole that movie his performance is best part of it the opposing team led by cary elwes dr jonas miller was excellent contrast in twister was great how they played them off each other what are other movies with team dynamics working on the highest level,"The movie 'Fugitive' excels in portraying the team dynamics of the main characters, adding dimensions to their personalities, and contrasting them with a one-note antagonist. Similarly, 'Twister' does a great job of highlighting each character's unique skill set and how they work together. Other films that feature excellent team dynamics include 'Along Came Polly,' where Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals the show with his charm and wit."

referring to any secret area compartment or room from hiding people from the nazis horror movie villains or super spy shit imo the most creative one was under the floor boards in inglorious bastards that is doable hate shotty hiding spots in movies like under the bed or in closet encanto in the walls was good for secret messages eating the message and doffing through the organs is tired trope there was one movie where the spin was the message was somehow printed on the back of the eyeball forgot the movie but that stuck with me,"Discussing secret compartments and rooms used to hide people from Nazis or spy movie villains, with a focus on creativity and practicality. Particular examples given are the use of floorboards in ""Inglorious Bastards"" and an inventive message delivery method in another movie where the message is eaten and retrieved from the victim's eyeball. The conversation criticizes lazy tropes like hiding in closets or behind walls."
it was very enjoyable see fans ranking it as third of the five indy movies ll go with that they did great job de aging harrison ford for the opening sequence apparently this was result of skilled direction as much cgi noted they cut the camera away from indy when he was about to do something too athletic and then cut back to him when the athletic thing was complete often action featuring indy was shot from the rear this quick cutting was also done in scenes where indy is being athletic for example in the scene where indy steals police horse we see him standing next to the horse then we see him on the horse but we don see him getting on the horse presumably octogenarian harrison ford understandably had little trouble there still ford is in fantastic shape for an year old he in good shape for any age when we watched the second ant man movie where they de aged michael douglas for flashback scenes noticed that douglas looked young but moved like an older man little stiff like his joints bothered him ford doesn have that stiffness in another instance of casting an older man in an action movie the the rock starred sean connery then years old noted at the time that the camera cut away whenever the action called for connery to run they had the right amount of pathos at the beginning friend who works in hollywood said hollywood writers eventually come to hate their characters and start to torture them which often makes long running tv shows hard to watch similarly at least one of the tobe maguire spider man sequels was downer featuring depressed peter parker dial of destiny could have gone that way as we open the sequence with washed up sad lonely indiana jones but the movie spent just the right amount of time on that bit before launching into the action where indy perks up they had the right amount of fanservice sometimes it seems like you need to take college class to appreciate the marvel movies or star trek or doctor who what with all the references to events and characters from previous movies and tv dial of destiny had just the right amount of that kind of thing hey it john rhys davies and there indy fedora bullwhip and leather jacket cool harrison ford does great oh shit face feel like this is formula in every indiana jones movie indy does something swashbuckly and sneers at his enemies he enjoys the triumph for moment and then realizes he badly outnumbered and outgunned oh shit was surprised by character development and feelings at the end didn expect quite so much heart phoebe waller bridge almost stole the movie and stealing an indiana jones movie from harrison ford is something could absolutely watch series of indiana jones sequels featuring waller bridge there be scene at the beginning of each movie where her character consults with indiana jones for few minutes but that would be the extent of indy involvement in the movie could also watch series of movies featuring archimedes as bronze age indiana jones don think the ancient greeks or romans had giant arrows that could be used to shoot down fighter planes don think they had much in the way of artillery at all unless you count catapults as artillery did they even have catapults idk but the ancient greece bits were fun the movie did great job recreating new york grew up on long island and spent time in new york in in the mid late and it was like that original,"The fan reviews of the latest Indiana Jones movie are positive. The opening sequence, featuring de-aged Harrison Ford, was a result of the director's skill combined with CGI. The action was shot in a way that concealed Ford's inability to perform certain athletic feats due to his age. The movie had just the right amount of fan service, pathos, and nostalgia. There is potential for future Indiana Jones movies featuring Phoebe Waller Bridge or Archimedes as the main character. 
The movie accurately represents New York City in the 1940s."

recently re watched contact and now am in the mood for movies with similar feel looking for movies that capture the same sense of wonder about space and the universe that felt while watching contact the films do not need to delve into religious or philosophical themes but am not opposed if they do am mainly focused on finding films that convey the joy of exploring new worlds and the vastness of space good example of this is many of the moments in interstellar,"You should watch the 2013 movie 'Gravity' directed by Alfonso Cuarón. It's about an astronaut named Dr. Ryan Stone who is on her first space mission alongside veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski. It depicts the vastness of space as well as the sense of awe and terror of Dr. Stone as she floats away from her space shuttle after it is destroyed and attempts to make her way back to Earth. 

Did you know that the film 'Gravity' took over three years to make and involved rigorous scientific training and preparation for the actors?Cuarón felt it was important for the actors to have a believable and realistic understanding of zero gravity conditions so they could portray those emotions and physicalities accurately on screen."

john wick set the standard and while silent night looks decent enough get too bent out of shape seeing annoying plot holes in films can anyone recommend any airtight or at least barely noticeable plot hole wise action revenge flicks mainly after the revenge sub genre but fine with action in general any help would be greatly appreciated,"You should watch 'John Wick' if you enjoy tightly-written, action-revenge films that are plot-hole free. Other recommendations in a similar vein would be 'El Chicano', 'Old', and 'Nobody'. If you don't mind plot holes, but still want a thrilling film, then you could watch 'Silent Night'."

twbb is one of the my favourite movies of all time and often can explain why it heavily revolves around ideas such as capitalism religion loneliness greed unchecked ambition etc daniel plainview is brilliant yet despicable man who you can stop watching aside from the obvious reasons such as it being an amazing character study along with an incredible performance by daniel day lewis what is the overall message of the movie which makes it so special in your opinion,"There Will Be Blood is an acclaimed movie that explores themes like capitalism, religion, loneliness, and greed. The main character, Daniel Plainview, is a complex figure who viewers love to hate. The movie is notable for its in-depth character study and the outstanding performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. The film's exploration of deep and relatable themes is a major reason why it is so highly regarded."

It's a romantic war drama film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and starring Audrey Tautou. It's a beautiful film, and although the story is carrying a bit of weight, it's very inspiring and uplifting. 

You might also like 'The Intouchables', which is another heartwarming French movie about a disabled rich man and his carer.

From Italy, you might like 'Call Me by Your Name', which is a romantic coming-of-age drama starring Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer. It's a slow-paced film that takes you on a journey of discovery, both emotionally and sexually. 

And from Germany, you could try 'Wings of Desire', which is a romantic fantasy drama film directed by Wim Wenders. It's a story about an angel who falls in love with a human and the struggles he faces as he tries to understand humanity.

with the exception of truly big name directors like steven spielberg ron howard ang lee etc it seems most directors have year gap or more between movies do they spend all that time developing their next project what if they do not have next project lined up it seems like director can only really do one thing where as actors or other creative roles are more flexible,"For most directors, there is a year or more gap between films, except for well-known directors like Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, and Ang Lee. Do they spend this time working on new projects? What happens if they don't have another project lined up?

edit thank you for your suggestions will check them out edit got the scenes that needed thank you for helping the scenes need are scene where someone is caught cheating on their significant other scene where character idea becomes incredibly warped to the point of obsession control and scene of person finally snapping from mental stress trauma will give no context other than the topic of the project review relates to these three things in some way,"I have obtained the necessary scenes for my project review.

don usually seek out this type of movie and didn know anything about it when watched it last night my wife happened to have it on when came to bed and for while actually thought melton character was teenager didn figure out what was going on until had been watching for about minutes and by the end of the movie was devastated can believe actually watched the whole thing because it was late and again not generally my type of film however melton so convincingly portrayed stunted teenager turned adult and his vulnerability and loss were captivating don think ve ever seen performance like it,Don is not a fan of this genre of movie but he was captivated by Melton's performance in the film he watched last night. Melton played a stunted teenager turned adult and Don was impressed by how vulnerable and lost he made him seem.  Don is shocked that he watched the whole movie as it was not his type of film and he only started watching because it was on in bed when he came to bed.
films in language other than english unfortunately are not popular in the it is real shame because one can miss out on so much great cinema however seemed to be the year some films that contained little to no english grabbed the public interests and broke through and entered the american culture pan labyrinth the lives of others apocalypto volver and letters from iwo jima were well received and were all or almost in another language besides english other films like babel the nativity story the fast and the furious tokyo drift and the last king of scotland contained lot of non english dialogue do you think there was another year similar to this or will there be another trend hopefully on the horizon,"Although films predominantly in a language other than English are not popular amongst mainstream American audiences, there have been a few that have managed to break through and garner mainstream success. Films such as 'Pan's Labyrinth', 'The Lives of Others', 'Apocalypto', and 'Volver' contained little to no English and were well received by many audiences."
by that do not mean so avant garde complicated or purposefully narrative less that could not understand what it is about like you re not supposed to understand un chien andalou that not what it was made for ll try to show what mean once when was staying at my mother place for holidays my mother husband he and me we sat in front of the tv and tim burton dark shadows was on half an hour in he asked me so what is this all about and could not come up with an answer though it was not the first time watched this movie there some fantasy vampire bs happening the visuals are typical tim burton johnny depp is quirky eva green is good looking chlo moretz is portraying sexualized minor again and really really do not care about this movie one little bit legit do not know what the point what the moral of the fable that you could present to year old person who has never fangirled over anyone or anything and not sound like moron so what movie is like this for you,"You may have seen a movie that does not have a deep or complex plot, and that you do not have to think too much to understand. An example you give is the Tim Burton movie ""Dark Shadows"", in which you do not need to comprehend the entire plotline of the film, but merely enjoy the visuals and performances of the actors."
cannot find this movie everywhere is there any information about this movie or its remaster found some short videos of it so think maybe there is full version out there somewhere believe that this film is on vhs but not sure if it has dvd or blu ray release am really desperate to watch this movie,"You might want to try searching for the title of the film along with keywords such as ""vhs collection,"" ""vintage film,"" or ""obscure movie."" It's also possible that the film may have a dedicated website or fan forum where you could find more information about its availability. If you haven't already, trying contacting local video stores or vintage film communities to see if they have any leads. 

It's worth noting that the availability of certain films can be influenced by factors such as copyright status, demand, and the resources available for restoring and distributing older films. Unfortunately, some films may not have widespread access due to these or other factors."
following the success of hostel back in ton of movies were released revolving around young beautiful people travelling to foreign places experiencing extreme terrors we got movies like the ruins eden lake hostel ii perfect getaway the hills have eyes the green inferno and many more despite the terrible reviews my favourite of the bunch is turistas turistas revolves around group of american backpacking through brazil and while travelling by bus their wreck less busdriver crashes the bus in the middle of nowhere now they have to wait hours for new bus but luckily they find an authentic and untouched piece of paradise close by but is it really paradise or rather hell the movie does of cause not get top points for its original plot but to me the movie is great example of how to do travel horror movie the movie covers plenty of topics backpackers can relate to think most backpackers have experienced insane bus trips where you fear for your life and many have also watched other backpackers take pictures of the local kids which to me has always seemed creepy in the movie the group ends up getting drugged at local bar and they get all their stuff stolen this is pretty realistic scenario and have even tried getting drugged myself at the happy viking in tenerife and it is also not unheard of that people get drugged at the moon light parties in thailand stranded in the middle of nowhere without money phones or passports what can you really do this is when you are at your most vulnerable with organ harvesters roaming the area things get even worse what really like about the movie is how it mixes the urban legend of organ harvesters with recognizable story matching many real backpacking trips on top of this the characters are likable the girls and surroundings are beautiful and the camera work is insane they have these underwater scenes that are just so well filmed and intense to watch it is unclear to me why to movie has gotten such low reviews and ratings my best guess is that some could consider it xenophobic because of its portrait of brazil but think the evil doctor is pretty good at explaining his motivation also do not think it is any more xenophobic that hostel or the green inferno if you love travel horror movies definitely think you should check this one out it get my highest recommendation,"Turistas is a 2006 horror movie about a group of American backpackers who travel to Brazil and encounter a series of dangerous events, including being drugged and having their valuables stolen, and ultimately falling victim to organ harvesters. The film realistically portrays the vulnerabilities and dangers faced by backpackers, and mixes in an urban legend of organ harvesting in Brazil. Despite its low ratings and reviews, the film is recommended for fans of travel horror movies."
one question analog film has very good resolution but the old scans were pretty bad and think that why old movies are in such bad quality isn it wouldn it be possible to just rescan them with better technology only if the original film is still out there of course so it should be possible to get movies like star wars for example to get in resolution or am thinking wrong,"The resolution of old films, such as Star Wars, might have seemed poor because the scanning technology of the time wasn't as good as it is today. However, it is possible to restore these films to a higher quality by rescanning the original film stock with better technology. As long as the original film is still intact, a new scan could provide better resolution and improve the quality of the picture."
there film out now called the end we start from that deals with woman on lonely trek before you watch that highly recommend similarly themed flick from the late great jean marc valle called wild it beautiful look at grief and memory and contains the best performance of reese witherspoon career she in the film for the entirety of the running time and she makes every frame count great supporting cast too especially laura dern,"You should watch the movie Wild, starring Reese Witherspoon in an outstanding performance. The late Jean-Marc Vallee directs a poignant film that explores grief and memory, following a woman on a journey of self-discovery. Witherspoon carries the film masterfully, and the supporting cast, including Laura Dern, is excellent. Wild is a similar movie to The End We Start From, so check it out if you're in the mood for a thought-provoking film about personal growth and transformation."
kind of random but ve been seeing nonstop ads for illumination upcoming kids movie migration and it has the release date few weeks from now never saw any of these ads before this week same thing with disney wish which only saw ads for weeks before release the rollout for these seem so much shorter than what seen with traditional adult films feel like we all saw promotions and ads for barbie for months before the release wondering if this is intentional marketing that saves money due to the target audience maybe due to child limited memory and information retention anyone else noticed this or am crazy,"You have noticed that there are far fewer advertisements for upcoming children's movies than there are for adult films. This may be intentional due to marketing targeting a younger audience with limited memory and retention, or it could be due to budgetary concerns."
just watched the trailer for freud last session in which anthony hopkins plays sigmund freud opposite matthew goode playing lewis anthony hopkins has himself played lewis before in shadowlands are there other examples of this can imagine there long running or rebooted franchises where they do this but struggling to think of any myself,"Anthony Hopkins has played opposite himself in the movie Freud's Last Session where he plays Sigmund Freud and Matthew Goode plays Lewis, and in the movie Shadowlands where Anthony played Lewis and Ralph Fiennes played Sigmund Freud. There are probably other examples in movies or TV series, where one actor plays multiple roles, or the same role in different installments or timelines of a story."

just watched video on youtube and the ad that came up was trailer for an upcoming bob marley biopic and out of curiosity watched the trailer instead of skipping and had moment of clarity in which noticed how utterly stupid and formulaic modern movie trailers are know we all have noticed that trailers these days are annoying and dumb but somehow it was so apparent in this one because this structure did not fit the topic of the movie at all to begin with these trailers are far too long they always use the same rythm of scenes the same chronology of emotions in those scenes the same little pieces of dialogue which are supposed to convey certain emotion or some gravitas then the pacing of the cuts becomes faster and song from the soundtrack is playing in weird version always with the same type of mix and sound then the fog horn blows and then small pause and some funny gag line and then the last screen coming in afterwards you feel like you ve already seen the full movie you also feel like the people who produce these think you re stupid because apparently the people producing these assume that the audience needs to see every story beat to somehow get feel for what the movie is about and needs the absolute maximum of grand epic music and soundeffects to feel anything even if it does not fit the story or topic at all does anyone know why of modern movie trailers follow this annoying pattern and who is responsible for these abominations most trailers see nowadays make me less inclined to watch the film in question,"The narrator has just watched a trailer for a biopic about Bob Marley, and they realize that modern movie trailers are overly long, use similar structures, and assume the audience is stupid. They wonder who is responsible for this decline in trailer quality and point out that these trailers make them less interested in watching the actual film."
star wars new hope had that famous poster where luke on rock is holding his light saber into the air with leia crouched below him few years later conan the barbarian had poster where conan on rock holds his sword into the air with woman forgot her name squatting down below him national lampoon vacation had poster with clark griswold on rock holding outdoor activity supplies up in the air with his wife and daughter at his feet was star wars the first to do this format where the male character holds something in the air while at least one female character is positioned below him in some show of hypermasculinity that seems to rely on the subjugation of women what other movie posters before or after follow this format,"Certain movie posters, like the one for Star Wars: A New Hope, feature a male character posed heroically with a female character below them, suggesting a portrayal of masculinity that relies on the subjugation of women. Was Star Wars the first to do this and do other movie posters feature this format?"
recently rewatched predator and halfway through it occurred to me that due to the predator code the average person would probably be perfectly fine in its presence so long as you didn get in its way it made me think of other instances where avoidance was likely the best response ones that immediately came to mind were the candyman and cenobites from hellraiser these are entities that generally need to explicitly be summoned before they start causing trouble what are some other monsters that upon further review aren as much of guaranteed doom than originally thought,"Sometimes it is better to avoid certain monsters than confront them, even if they appear to be relatively harmless upon first glance. Predators only attack if they are provoked, and the same goes for the Candyman, and Cenobites from Hellraiser. These monsters only cause trouble if they are summoned, making them somewhat avoidable entities."
we all need to update our lists of great christmas movies and feel this year we should all collectively come together and bring the ice harvest to notice it has everything you want in wintry special around the holidays elements of noir like mystery murder snow ice comedy billy bob thornton the great character actor oliver platt and led by the fearless and under appreciated john cusack oh and it is directed by none other than harold ramis come on most of you probably know this movie but so many people do not it never got its chance to shine yeah die hard is christmas movie but if there ever were the perfect non christmassy christmas movie it this happy holidays,"The movie Ice Harvest is a great movie to watch during the holidays, as it has a wintery theme, with elements of mystery, murder, comedy, and snow. It is led by John Cusack and also features Billy Bob Thornton and Oliver Platt. It is directed by Harold Ramis. Many people haven't heard of this movie, but it is worth giving it a watch this holiday season."
know that bit hyper specific but curious if there anything out there for this late saturday night ideally human conflict and not supernatural or sci fi where someone being hunted either through land or some urban city locale or even being watched can be actiony but looking for more of an uneasy tone than blockbuster chase thank you,"You're looking for a movie with a hunt or pursuit theme that takes place in an urban environment, preferably with a tense and suspenseful tone, and low on sci-fi or supernatural elements. Preferably something with human conflict as the driving force of the story."
what the absolute fuck she kills goose watches porn fucks scarecrow bathes in front of her dad irrationally kills everyone loses her mind in front of the judges goes on the longest monologue ve ever witnessed and then it ends on cliffhanger it was so jaw droppingly weird that had to look up reviews and saw nothing but great reviews that when took my search to reddit and learned that it prequel with context it might be great movie but alone that was certainly an experience,"You are surprised that a movie featuring a bizarre sequence of events culminating in a cliffhanger actually has good reviews. Looking at Reddit, you learn that the movie is a prequel and maybe should be watched in context of the previous ones to make sense of it."
this is kind of controversial topic but promise just interested in the movies story and the understanding of the ending want to start by saying am not racist some may think this is over exaggerated but as of recent post ve seen in subreddits want to make sure my choice of words are delicate accurate and appropriate this question is purely for the movies story educational purposes in lakeview terrace abel played by samuel jackson just have to add love this actor pulp fiction so many great movies he been in fantastic actor digress abel seems to dislike the couple husband chris it later becomes obvious that he has huge problem with white male romantically involved with black female even later in the film though he even treats the wife of the couple lisa with massive disrespect the way sam jack portrayed this character was fantastic as much as love him as actor he did so great to make me really hate this abel character understand the part of him disrespecting the wife since his own wife left him just cannot seem to find out why he hated chris for being white married to lisa when he had the same hatred for her sure overlooked something really enjoyed the movies story and was hoping you guys could help educate me on what missing in the narrative thanks guys appreciate you,"You are wondering why the character Abel, played by Samuel L. Jackson in the movie Lakeview Terrace, hates Chris, a white male character, for being romantically involved with a black female character, Lisa. You are interested in understanding his motivation and why he extends his hatred to Chris when he also dislikes Lisa. 

You are specifically asking for an educational perspective on this aspect of the movie's story."

just watched eastern promises and feel the depiction of the russian mob was really interesting with nice attention to detail what other movies submerse you into these type of words examples like yakuza story line but it doesn have to be crime related or modern times feel like last duel also did good job of implanting the watcher in that world curious if anyone has recommendations on main streaming platforms,"You should watch 'Animal Kingdom' if you want to feel immersed in the world of criminal organizations, as depicted in 'Eastern Promises'. Other crime-related films with vivid settings include 'Top Boy', 'Gangs of London' and 'The Irishman'. If you're open to subtitles, Asian movies like 'Memories of the Sword' and 'A Taxi Driver' do an excellent job of drawing you into their settings and storylines."

You are looking for similar movies, preferably in the horror-thriller genre, involving a group of people trapped in a confined space and being hunted by a scary monster. Suggestions welcome. 

Did you know that Alien director Ridley Scott drew inspiration from the sci-fi horror film Alien by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, as well as other films such as Psycho and Jaws?"

this is an old christmas movie remember that they are life size toys like ballerina and male character im not sure if he is like soldier or what but they are in love santa talks to them because they are going to go back to sleep this is what remember from little bits of memory not really sure if what remember is true am from and pretty sure we had this movie in vhs cassette any help is appreciated,"You are describing ""The Nutcracker"" or ""Nutcracker Suite"". It is a famous old Tchaikovsky ballet adapted as an animated movie possibly multiple times over the years. 

In the story, there are life-sized toys that come to life onstage once the children are asleep on Christmas Eve. These include a ballerina and a soldier. The Nutcracker himself, battles against the Mouse King with the help of his toy soldiers and wins. 

It is a timeless holiday classic and many families, yours included, may have owned the VHS version to watch during Christmas season."
in home alone kate stays at paris orly airport waiting for flight home to chicago to get to her son kevin who was left home alone as quickly as possible she was able to get flight to dallas then scranton where she got stranded polka band offered to take her home in the van they rented she managed to get home few minutes before the rest of the family who took the original flight they booked why didn she try to go to charles de gaulle airport charles de gaulle is much larger and has had much higher passenger count than orly since the earliest could find there likely would have been more flights out of it than orly meaning chance that some flights to chicago wouldn be full it may be small plot hole but ve been wondering about it since saw it again last week,"In the movie Home Alone, Kate McCallister (played by Catherine O'Hara) stranded at the Paris Orly airport, attempts to fly home to Chicago to her son Kevin, accidentally left alone at home. 

You are wondering why she didn't take flights from Charles de Gaulle airport, closer to Paris, speculating that it might have been easier for her to find a flight given the higher passenger volume at that airport.

hey guys just watched the movie the exorcist the devotee and have few things to say really enjoyed the film it truly scared me more than the first one found it very interesting how pazuzu deceived the families by asking them to choose between the two girls it was crazy because he said one lives the other dies but did not specify what action would be taken for the chosen one and when they chose the girl she ended up dying so he kind of deceived them to assert his dominance found that fascinating also liked how all the religions came together and tried to exorcise the girls according to their beliefs as chico xavier would say we respect all religions and believe that wherever the name of god is spoken good can be done,"The movie The Exorcist: The Devout was more scary than the first in the series. The demon Pazuzu tricked the families by offering a deal — one girl lives, and one dies. The twist was that the chosen girl died, and the demon was asserting his dominance. The exorcism attempt involved multiple religions, and it was respectful towards them."
so today while scrolling through reddit saw post where someone made joke about an actor being able to play someone from formula because of the visual likeness of the actor obviously that was joke but it did make me wonder how important is it that someone playing certain character looks the part and would you prefer someone who had more similar appearance over someone that can actually act better and what about aspects like mannerisms behavior speech gestures etc personally would say those are more important than actually looking the part for example in downfall der untergang bruno ganz doesn fully look the part but the way he plays adolf hitler with all his verbal and non verbal aspects makes it masterful performance so what do you guys think regarding this topic and what are some of the examples you have,"A Reddit user wonders how important it is that an actor resembles the character they are playing, asking if mannerisms and other performances aspects are more important. They cite Bruno Ganz's performance in ""Downfall"" as an example of an actor not visually resembling their character, Adolf Hitler, but nonetheless delivering a masterful performance through mannerisms and speech. The original poster asks for others' opinions on this topic and examples of their own."
so my wife and were watching the polar express and we started commenting on different parts of the movie that are legitimately creepy and other parts where each of us would change some detail about the story in order to switch the tone to horror my favorite was the boy finds out at the end of the film that every year when child is chosen for the first gift of christmas that child is sacrificed in order to supply santa sleigh with it christmas magic what are some other changes,"You and your wife watched The Polar Express and noted parts of the movie that could be altered to make it a horror film. One idea you had was to change the premise so that the first gift of Christmas symbolizes a child sacrifice to empower Santa's magic sleigh each year. You want to know other ideas from viewers. 

Did you know The Polar Express was authored by Chris van allsburg, who studied architecture and has many other books with eerie illustrations?"

ve always been impressed at the small number of times that you can actually notice an actor who is supposed to be dead breathing is there an industry standard method of handling this or is it just assumed that professional actor knows what to do can think of some scenes that hold single shot with corpse in clear focus for minute or more anyone with personal experience,"The acting industry has methods to ensure that corpses in movies do not appear to be breathing, even when they are in focus for long periods of time. Professional actors are capable of holding their breath for extended periods, and film crews use tactics like bladders, fans, and special effects to disguise signs of life."

The book was better."
as far as can tell it neither hare or midway rewatching the movie this year realized for movie that takes place in chicago it strange how little chicago is actually used for locations considering how movie friendly chicago has always been it really feels odd that they set the movie in chicago but really didn use it other than for few long distance shots,"While watching the movie Hare and Midway, I realized that Chicago is barely used for locations even though it is film-friendly. It is strange that they set the movie in Chicago but failed to use it extensively for location shots other than a few long-distance shots."
hi am looking for list of movies where characters are moral or enact some great self sacrifice for others something that would inspire you to be better person my example would be john proctor daniel day lewis in the crucible at the end when he refuses to sign the confession which ultimately leads to his death have learned most of my life lessons from movies as sad as that sounds so wanted some examples of moral characters that could show my kids rather than the characters of today who in my view as much less heroic any suggestions of scenes where there are heroics that made you inspired or cry they do not have to be kid friendly as will show them to my kids when they are old enough thank you,"I am looking for movie examples of heroic or morally upright characters who make sacrifices for others, like Daniel Day-Lewis' John Proctor in The Crucible.

know we will never get it with willis retiring and everything still wish they had made another one in or hear it was going to be part prequel and follow mcclane in his early days honestly think that is bad idea think the whole point of die hard was to show he is an ordinary man who is thrust into all of this if they had made sixth and final film hope it would be about the son or nephew of hans gruber coming and tracking him down to exact his final revenge on mcclane also they should have gotten good director for it know len wiseman was going to direct it and he did decent job with but wanted new blood to be honest sad it never happened,"Die Hard 6 was supposed to be released but ultimately got canceled. The user is suggesting they make another one, but set it as a prequel following John McClane in his early days.

tell me you most and least favourite christmas movie ll start my most favourite is the holiday with cameron diaz and kate winslet love it so much it such great film with an amazing ensemble cast love the premise too women from different countries decide to swap houses to get away from their sticky romantic lives and wind up finding what they both needed my least favourite and may get some hate for this is elf as much as love will farrell just don enjoy this movie had good cast but it just weird okay your turn,"My favorite movie is The Holiday because of its ensemble cast and interesting premise. My least favorite is Elf, despite a strong cast, because I find it weird."
throughout the years have realized that really like movies that thier initial problem keeps getting more and more out of hand sometimes the problem at the end has nothing to do with the initial one some examples of this are the big lebowsky superbad ferris buellers day off do you have more recommendations of movies of this kind,"I like movies where the problem keeps getting bigger and bigger. For example, in The Big Lebowski, the problem evolves from a stolen car to a kidnapped friend; in Superbad, it escalates from an awkward meeting with a girl to a out-of-control party with the police involved; and in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, it grows from skipping school to needing to return home in time to save Ferris' life."
referring to their acting being so convincing that you didn recognize them even if it was only for minute before it clicked of course make up and artistry helps to transform them but talking about minimal physical transformation not heavy prosthetics or cgi for example which would obviously disguise person well josh brolin thanos bill skarsgard pennywise etc these would likely be movies where it wasn heavily promoted that this actor would be playing this role so you didn know it was them in advanced curious about who genuinely pulled the wool over your eyes they were that good for me few people come to mind gillian anderson as margaret thatcher in the crown that scully didn realize until halfway through the season also stanley tucci in lot of roles surprise me didn recognize him at first in lovely bones or as caesar in hunger games toni collette is another one didn recognize in about boy at first and the fact she was the same person who played the mom in sixth sense,"Some actors are so good at their craft, that they can convincingly transform into a character, to the point where people didn't recognize them, even without the use of heavy prosthetics or CGI. Several examples include Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher in ""The Crown"", Stanley Tucci in many roles, Toni Collette in ""About a Boy"", and Josh Brolin as Thanos."
by pre apocalyptic mean movies where the apocalypse is about to happen or just started to happen and the characters must prepare for it or make sense of it recently watched both miracle mile and last night and loved them both last night in particular has been in my head rent free for about week and haunted by the movie ending which left many questions unanswered what are some other movies like this,"You should watch movies that are similar to 'Last Night' and 'Miracle Mile', which are movies where the apocalypse is about to happen or has just begun, and wherein the characters must deal with it or try to figure out what's going on. 

Some movies you might enjoy include 'Survivor', 'Take Shelter', and 'The Road'. 

Did you have a specific genre in mind when you asked for movies similar to 'Miracle Mile' and 'Last Night'?"
threads is this really eerily realistic nuclear war simulation film that was shot on shoe string budget back in it was tv movie and released year after the day after another film which depicted nuclear war and infamously even got ronald reagan shaken up about nuclear weapons but while the day after sort of stops just shy of showing the true effects of nuclear weapons threads goes way beyond that showing that the dropping of the bomb is just the beginning from showcasing the decay of society to the well acted out scenes of misery and suffering the scenes show just how bleak life is not just days after the first bombs are dropped but even years after from the building up of tensions to how it profiles each family only to then make you sit through each family slow demise what makes me place this movie slightly above the day after is how it gets even the little things right the way it shows the explosion is also quite accuarate for example when the bombs drop you see the entire screen go to white flash which interestingly is what would happen in real life that blinding flash is rays which people have reported means you can see the bones of your body as the flash goes off the movie effects are quite realistic given the budget and the scenes of destruction are really believable the movie leaves you feeling colder and colder with each passing scene as you sit there hoping for happy ending but it never arrives each surviving character resorts to all sorts of mental destruction as they struggle to comprehend with post nuclear life by the end of it you re left numb that last scene will break you won spoil it but let just say that the deathly silent credits that roll just after that scene will leave you wondering whether it even worth it to survive nuclear war because what follows is anything but roses for years later societal collapse nuclear winter rape famine torture anarchy breakdown of government lack of food cannibalism and worst of all genetic defects for generations after so even if you try to procreate you re not out of the woods for the future generation made the mistake of watching threads last night and it has shaken me up for the better or worse and as our world tethers once again on the brink of nuclear annihilation driven by mad men suddenly find myself gravitating towards threads and really wish more world leaders would give it watch,"Threads is a TV movie depicting the realities of a nuclear war. It showcases the decay of society after the dropping of the bombs and the years that follow. It portrays the misery and suffering of the survivors, displaying the bleakness of life after such an event. The movie is realistic and accurate in its portrayal, leaving the viewers feeling numb and questioning the value of survival. Threads highlights the potential consequences of nuclear war, including societal collapse, nuclear winter, rape, famine, torture, anarchy, and genetic defects for future generations. Some may find watching Threads disturbing due to its graphic content, but it can also be a powerful tool to educate people about the harsh realities of nuclear war."
he seen all the jurassic and marvel movies he wants something more grownup we watched predator with his cousins and he really liked it was thinking terminator so we could then watch the second one where he would not know arnie is the good guy commando gladiator fifth element running man or district he liked the premise of but worried it not what he ll be expecting update we watched minute synopsis of terminator and then watched he snuggled up to me during the thumbs up scene,"You could watch 'Commando', 'Gladiator', 'The Fifth Element', 'Running Man' or 'District 13'. Your son liked the idea of Terminator because it's more grown up fare, so perhaps stick with those suggestions unless he specifically wants to watch Terminator sequels. You watched a minute synopsis of Terminator and he seemed to like it, so you could watch that film next."
was watching gen on amazon prime admittedly show not film but there was scene in one episode where little girl gets handed pill and immediately downs it no liquid nothing just had random flashbacks to all the times people have done it in films neo accepting the red pill in matrix tyler durden not tyler durden downing his anti psychotics in flight club will smith just fuckin chuggin bottle of anti depressants after having to kill his infected dog in am legend think it one of my new least favourite movie tropes who the fuck takes pills that way is that an american thing like leaving your shoes on inside,You dislike it when people in films and TV shows gulp down pills without any liquid. You find it unrealistic and unhealthy and wonder if it's an American thing as shoes-inside-houses trope is.

The cinematography and direction by James Cameron are also highlighted as factors that make the film a strong piece of cinematic art. The narrator recalls a positive theatre experience upon the film's initial release and looks forward to a special edition release on Tuesday."
have to choose movie that engages evolves or breaks the conventions of either the action noir detective sci fi or western genres movies that combine genres are fine was thinking about doing serenity by joss whedon but haven watched the firefly series in while and it probably not the best example of breaking the mold of its genre but just the subject of sci fi western is so fun,"You should choose a movie that either breaks conventions or evolves the conventions of the action, noir, detective or sci-fi genres. However, you mention that you are thinking about Serenity, but you are unsure if it is a good example of breaking genre conventions. 

Would you like me to provide other movie recommendations that fit this description? 

Remember, movies that combine genres are also acceptable."
starring robert deniro edward norton and marlon brando in his final film role this is such good effing movie deniro plays thief who reluctantly agrees to pull one last job working with his fence brando it tense exciting and even bit funny deniro and brandon play so well off each other and the setting montreal is unique and beautiful would recommend this awesome flick to anyone who enjoys good heist movie,"Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, and Marlon Brando star in this heist movie that takes place in Montreal. The legendary duo of De Niro and Brando deliver tense, exciting, and at times humorous performances that complement each other well. The city of Montreal also adds to the uniqueness of this film. If you enjoy heist movies, this is a must-watch."

In Oppenheimer, all sound ceases when the bomb drops apart from the character's dialogue, creating a powerful moment. A similar technique is employed in The Last Jedi with the Hyperspace Ram."

ve always heard of it knew nothing about it but last night it ran as late movie here in la at the nuart hemmed and hawed was not sure about going but wow loved it read up little beforehand without being spoiled and learned it was very artistic very cinematic and lush and beautifully shot with somewhat limited story and controversial at the time and it was but totally loved it by the end it definitely leisurely paced but the first minutes or so are worth it watching the thief great performance and an amazing amount of dialogue be crass low brow mean and violent all while not realizing he building up an army of detractors then leading into the last act and having it all turned on him afterwards read this great interview with helen mirren by roger ebert in which she talks about flying to america to convince the ratings board to not give it an rating she failed and hearing her describe the state of american films back in was pretty funny it long at hours but worth it cannot believe there an actual minute cut of it to appease major video stores back in the day,"You should watch 'The Thief of Bagdad' if you enjoy artistic, cinematic and beautifully shot movies with a controversial storyline.

hi curious how lgbtq film fans feel about mel brooks lot of his classic films have gay characters whose sexuality is punchline obviously it was different time yada yada yada feel like he treats gay people as some kind of strange curiosity personally do not get hateful vibe exactly but then again blazing saddles ends with bunch of cowboys beating up gay dancers anyway love his films and consider them comedy masterpieces but masterpieces can be complicated and problematic and guess it makes me little sad to think that large number of people might feel disenfranchised or targeted just curious what the different views are in the lgbtq film community not interested in defense of the man or his films do not think he needs it just curious how he is viewed thanks,"Some of Mel Brooks' classic films feature gay characters whose sexuality is used as a punchline, and the way LGBTQ+ people are treated in his films varies from problematic to hateful.  LGBTQ+ people view his films differently, with some appreciating the representation and others feeling disenfranchised and targeted.  This is merely an exploration of views within the LGBTQ+ film community and is not an invitation to defend the filmmaker.  His films are considered masterpieces but are complicated and problematic."

so just finished watching the fantastic xmas movie die hard and there is one bit that dont get the logic behind when john comes across hans in the upper floors where the was planted and hans pretends to be hostage he says his name is bill clay the camera then zooms onto directory board that shows many names and then focuses on clay which is obviously william bill clay th floor do not understand the significance of this or how this kinda confirms for john to be suspicious of bill handing him the empty gun and expecting him to turn on him at least that how ve interpreted this exchange is there something im missing regarding bill clay and how this was giveaway to john do not think bill is mentioned at all before this point so it not like he was introduced to him at the party right any clarity on this would be great thanks,"You are wondering what the significance is of the name Bill Clay being on the directory board in the building where Hans Gruber is holding everybody hostage in Die Hard.  It is likely that Bill Clay was a plant as well, just like John McClane, and Hans uses Clay's identity to try and throw John off his scent when handing over the empty gun.  Hans likely chose Clay because he was a name he had seen on the directory board moments earlier.  Clay is likely not mentioned prior because it would give his identity away too soon."
never saw the hunger games because not the target demographic male but it was so popular that always kind of assumed that the movies were at least decent well decided to read the books because learning second language so read the first book in spanish and quite enjoyed it although it hard to evaluate the quality of writing in second language think really enjoyed it because it was straightforward narration of events that was easy to follow looked into the first movie and saw generally positive reviews so decided to give watch damn this movie is shit everything about it is so uninspired the script is uninspired the direction the sets the costumes everything when you get that many bad performances out of so many otherwise decent actors it is not the actors fault it shitty script and shitty direction get that it was relatively low budget movie so can give some grace on the sets and costumes being cheap but man the script and the acting directing are just unforgivable jennifer lawrence and woody harrelson are trying but they can only do so much when everything around them is trashfire how can movie about kids murdering each other end up so flat and boring there was no tension even though in the books she is close to death so many times really went into this with an open mind and even actually wanting and expecting to like it with quite reasonable expectations of being decent or at least competent but not necessarily great but was still disappointed guess can understand how it became sensation for kids but how is this on imdb read that catching fire is better reading the book rn should watch the movie when done or am gonna hate it just as much also this is an aside but laughed my ass off when she shot cato with an arrow as an act of mercy lol like how is that going to improve the situation you re getting torn apart by dogs and someone shoots you with an arrow now you re getting torn apart by dogs with an arrow sticking out of you in the books it kind of makes sense because the dogs refuse to kill cato and peeta is dying so she wants to hurry it along guess it would be quick death if she shot him right in the skull or heart,"The movie adaptation of The Hunger Games disappointed the reviewer, who had gone in with moderate expectations. They felt that the movie was poorly scripted and directed, and that it lacked tension despite featuring children fighting to the death.

black mirror charlie booker is fan probably gave him some ideas and he once dubbed it the winner of the biggest lurch in tone award given how radically different in direction the film goes after one pivotal scene the first act is basically cute romantic comedy with anthony edwards and mare winningham falling in love in after meeting at the la brea tar pits complete with comically missed connection due to home alone style alarm failure but the film then takes hard left turn when edwards answers ringing payphone yes children those were real once and gets the worst wrong phone call of all time from hysterical soldier trying to warn his dad that nuclear war is about to break out seriously the whole scene is absolutely chilling from start to finish and like bucket of ice water to the face after the light hearted first act and then the film promptly descends into nightmarish race for edwards to find his newly acquired love and escape an rapidly devolving into chaos as rumors spread and mass hysteria about apocalypse takes over but is it even real or is it war of the worlds style hoax that question just adds to the tension and the film maintains it all the way to the dark downbeat ending for film that started out so light and cheerful the later two thirds are just shocking in how different it is you understand why the script was both long considered one of the best unmade scripts in hollywood and why it took so long to make it was once considered to be used as the twilight zone movie and why it flopped on release heartwarming post note anthony edwards and mare winningham befriended each other while making the film and continued their friendship since as of they re married,"The movie starts out as a lighthearted romantic comedy, but takes a dark turn when a phone call warns of an impending nuclear war. The rest of the film descends into a race to escape the chaos as rumors spread and mass hysteria takes over. The question of whether the threat is real adds to the tension, and the film ends on a dark and downbeat note."
apologies in advance do not know if this counts as spoiler but do not think it does rewatched misery yesterday for the first time in few years and something struck me that have never seen anyone else talk about before after annie makes paul burn his new book because he killed off misery she makes him write new one but when he writes the new one he writes misery back to life annie says something about her being mistakenly buried alive but that implies that the events of the now non existent book still happened if the new book is replacement of the destroyed one misery should not have to be brought back to life it should be follow up to the book before the destroyed one when misery was still alive is there something missing or has anyone else ever noticed this,"While re-watching Misery, I noticed that although Paul burns the novel he has written about Misery, he then writes a new novel in which he brings Misery back to life. This implies that the events of the first novel still occurred, when they should not have if the new novel is a replacement for the first. Have I missed something or is this a flaw in the story?"
we all have that one actor that during really intense scene or even an intense day in your life will walk through door their presence signals safety to you you feel like everything will be okay now because they re here think for me it liam neeson ever since saw taken but it doesn need to be an action hero in fact it probably shouldn be just happened to wake up,"There are certain actors whose presence alone, even if they arrive midway through a film or show, can instantly make viewers feel safer. Liam Neeson, for instance, has starred in many action films where he plays the role of a hero who protects people, but similar feelings of safety and reassurance can be induced by other actors in different genres or even in everyday life. 

Who is your favorite actor who makes you feel safe? Feel free to share a specific scene or memory of theirs that makes you feel reassured."

edit everyone is telling me that my point of discussion is not clear my point of discussion is that disney pixar started making less money after toy story and frozen and in my opinion the reason for this is because the movies are bad because they prioritize message over entertainment think these movies are boring for kids except encanto which kids seem to like on disney everyone disagrees with me and say they love these movies okay but what is your explanation for the lower box office or do you consider that the recent movies are just as financially successful as the movies from the if not do you think that they are less financially successful for reasons other than being boring for kids original post know too old for disney movies but was not fan of disney movies when was kid only started liking them as an adult weirdly so it not like completely blinded by nostalgia it just seems like in the past years all their movies have been bad the first warning sign was ralph breaks the internet but they were not lost yet because toy story and frozen were still good they have their detractors but they both made billion so think most people liked them then think soul was good too including pixar and disney together because they had similar management but can we agree that onward turning red lightyear strange world and elemental are all terrible suppose each one will have its defenders saying no actually really like that one but think they are all terrible like the filmmaker just wanted to deliver message about their own personal life and the studio did not realize it not fun think none of them wanted to make fun movie they wanted to tell movie about their dead dad or their overbearing parents or the crippling obsession with past mistakes and then they thought they could add the fun later as an after thought encanto was also sort of therapy movie where the climax is the grandmother apologizing to the filmmaker insertion protagonist but think encanto goes down better than the others because it did entertain people with its songs and tropical colors but seriously what is it with these filmmakers and their fantasy of making their parents admit they were wrong and apologize to them wish was supposed to be return to classic fairy tale but think they still could not help themselves they had to bang the audience over the head with the message make your own wish come true,The topic of discussion is whether Disney Pixar's recent movies are bad for prioritizing message over entertainment and hurting their box office sales compared to older movies like Toy Story and Frozen. The speaker is debating whether Encanto was able to succeed because of its entertainment value despite also having a similar message.
title does anyone know any movie adaptations of books which despite the producer intending to make faithful adaptation receive backlash from audience they can be of any reason such as the source material containing outdated politically incorrect messages and thoughts and they were included in the adaptation as well,"Certain movie adaptations of books have received criticism from audiences for their purportedly faithful rendering of dated, politically incorrect ideas and thoughts from the source material.

she very picky in everything and does not read that often but as an avid reader see the value in it and think it is one of the easiest ways to become smarter or seem more knowledgeable something pretty beginner friendly but obviously not extremely so think would be the best to introduce her to reading as hobby she likes reading about other cultures and time periods but does not like fantasy or sci fi read number the stars by lois lowry and the diary of anne frank when was and was originally considering one of those but to this day remember how much of an impact both of those stories especially the latter had on me and do not think they were fully positive so wanted something that informative but not too much at once thanks,"You would like to introduce your friend, who is picky and doesn't read often, to reading as a hobby.

Despite these feelings, they admit the book has its positives, though they feel it could have been trimmed as well."
first thing up we love golden retriever mmc who also gives you look at her and you die vibes overall truly enjoyed this book bailey fmc was little slower with the character development in my opinion bailey started the book off by being dumped so of course she was little shell shocked plus her roommates were awful she felt as if she was on an island with no escape not even her own brother was able to help her in the beginning once chase mmc came into the picture things started to look up keelan also mentioned bailey height multiple times in the book bailey was not made to be like other sport romance fmc which are tiny she praised and never gave up on loving chase during the book you could tell that chase wanted to protect bailey at all costs even if it was his own happiness chase starts the book off with the playboy type but develops into golden retriever for bailey my favorite quote from chase was when he was talking to himself about bailey and getting to spend more time with her chapter page the look on morrison face tonight awesome getting to spend time with james even better kissing her fuck me over my head this was the starting point of their relationship and only went up from there when it came to the third act was hoping for no third act breakup but it made so much better however it tied everything in the story line perfectly crazy plot during the break this is book that would recommend for someone looking to jump into sports romance personally would have liked chapter where chase meets all of bailey brothers hoping that derek only one of bailey brothers that played big part in the story gets his own book so can like him more hated how he did not protect his sister from the start,"Bailey is dumped by her partner and has difficult roommates, but things start to look up when she meets Chase, who protects her and develops into a loyal Golden Retriever character. The story has a crazy plot twist in the third act, but ultimately leads to a happy ending. The book would be a good recommendation for someone looking to read a sports romance. Chase and Bailey's relationship grows throughout the book, and Chase goes from a playboy-type to a loyal partner."
recently online bought copy of doctorow welcome to hard times it penguin random house trade paperback that is made by one of the big five publishers however the quality is clearly subpar have handled decent amount of print on demand pod books in my time and if did not know better swear this book was produced pod stark white cheap paper that velveteen feeling cover that better pod books have and the terrible print quality that the worse pod books have talking kind of artifacting of the letters where it looks as if microscopic bugs have been munching at their edges what worse this is not the first time ve had this hunch while handling book what going on am crazy,"You are disappointed with the quality of the paperback copy of ""Welcome to Hard Times"" you bought online, as the paper and print quality appear to be inferior, resembling many print-on-demand books. You suspect that Penguin Random House, one of the big five publishers, may have outsourced the printing to a pod company with questionable quality standards."
its book that toys with human emotions passionate love story between two humans mind you that draws you ever so clearly until it takes place inside your mind for quite while this is story of individuals in raw unadulterated love the feeling of vulnerability oozes out of the book in many magnificent scenes of togetherness its not so much as the book not manages to captures the intimacy between the couple well but its true excellence lies in letting us in the moment of togetherness perfectly personally did not feel spectator of the events but can actually feel the warmth of the love between them the book is easily one of the books that ever read it also can server as the template of how to write romantic book perfectly the book is best as it front loads in letting us know the emotions as experienced by our characters efficiently and subtly its the emotions that instantly feels relatable to us as we the humans deals with same insecurities thoughts ideas and capacity to love the book in more than occasions may stop you in tracks as it hits too close to home its book that dosent want to please you for the sake of plot and characters it really isnt oblivious of the dynamism of the real world and is acutely aware of our dissonance in dealing with life and the relationship the life is unfair sometime grossly unfair even more so when people themselves are flawed all of them trying to find their identity in world and maybe find that someone for which the life seems lot more tolerable and pleasure to share the life with they say we all are different but in the end we are just sane people harboring the same anxiety and feelings this results in lot of intricacy where nothing is certain and things are liable to get completely destroyed in the blink of the eye even with the feeling that these complications are involved people do love each other selflessly and unconditionally the book is story of one such couple ending the book left me in state of cluttered emotions all could think about the inexplicable sadness of the book the fallacy of humans minds in love yet deeply grateful to read story about two individuals inexplicably finding each other they could not have been more different and yet with them together one cant picture them separate think it should be must read,"This book is a beautiful exploration of the raw and intimate moments of a romantic relationship, leaving the reader feeling immersed and invested in the story. It beautifully portrays the vulnerability and complexity of human emotions, love, and relationships. The characters are relatable and realistic, and the story is a poignant reminder of the power of love to overcome obstacles. This book is a must-read for fans of romantic stories."
my vision is horrible so do all my reading on my kindle the adjustable font size means can keep reading ve always had the ad supported version since that became an option in all these years there has been only one ad that was not for book tide so have not minded seeing the ads at all like seeing what other books are out there that is until the last few weeks authors have started flooding the ads with ai generated childrens books tracked one of them down to the publisher ai site which bills itself as improving storytelling through human ai collaboration all you need to do is write prompt as brief as characters long pick an art style for the cover and press button it creates the whole book for you there even publish on amazon button as test to see if it was really that easy asked it to write book about getting revenge on authors who use ai to write books at least that gave me laugh,"Due to the recent increase in ads for Ai-written books on her Kindle, which she uses because of its adjustable font size for her poor vision, the narrator is concerned about the quality of books and the state of the publishing industry. She has found these books to be of lower quality and intends to seek revenge on those who utilize AI through writing a book of her own."
just polished off the fabulous new silvia moreno garcia novel silver nitrate she is just so entertaining she never let me down yet but man getting these glaring errors are such huge record scratches when reading the misspelling of ley lines as lay lines is not such big deal guess but there was bit on in the hardcover where montserrat refers to meeting with character she had not met at all least as far as she knows at that point and it referred to again bit after that essentially the wrong character name was used twice do publishers and authors care about this what does one do tweet at them email someone somewhere or let it gooooo,"The new Silvia Moreno Garcia novel, Silver Nitrate, was entertaining, but contained several errors, including the misspelling of ley lines as lay lines and the incorrect character name repeated twice. Do publishers and authors care about this type of error, and what can be done about it?"
read this book full title how to stay married the most insane love story ever told on recommendation from favorite reviewer have no prior experience with its author harrison scott key and after finishing the book can confidently say ll have no future experiences with him in summary this is story of infidelity and the author attempt to save his marriage this book is presented on inside flap as comic romp unlike any in contemporary literature ok inside flap writer but did you actually read the book key comes across as douchebag primarily capable of using sarcasm as deflection to cover his many shortcomings as partner he leans heavily on christianity throughout the book the good parts of which he showers upon himself look at me have few flaws but martyr and the bad parts he saves for his wife look at her she mess without me and have to save her we re even treated to chapter near the end of the book written by his wife who in few pages summarizes the trauma that took the author close to to cover pages of judgement smothered in layer of sarcasm hooray glad read this book if only to validate the dangers of patriarchy religious groupthink and upholding the status quo key is walking billboard for those things,"This book is a comic romp about infidelity and the author's attempt to save his marriage. However, the author, Harrison Scott Key, comes across as a martyr who uses sarcasm to cover up his own shortcomings as a partner. His heavy reliance on Christianity throughout the book is used to deflect from his own flaws and onto his wife. This book serves as a warning against patriarchy, religious groupthink, and upholding the status quo.

obviously exaggerating with the title because haven read percent of romance but if you are sick to death of enemies to lovers like am then you will understand that rereading twilight was like breath of fresh air they actually like each other yeah they re like bickering for the first part but it so obvious that bella is super into edward and after the halfway part they don even bother to do the will they won they they totally will and that what feels so refreshing they re both gloomy weirdos who think they re better than the people around them they read the same books bella thinks edward is hot if he watches her sleep she literally doesnt care and it vampire story the appeal of the creepy weird hot guy has been documented for ages lot of romances have enemies to lovers with nothing in common they couldn hang out or have fun buying groceries but totally believe bella and edward could it not even love triangle bella never wants jacob but really is edward is creepy stalker yeah little and that ok because bella is totally cool with it bella would also be creepy stalker if she could she immediately obsessed with him despite him literally telling her to leave him alone these two pretentious losers only care about each other the entire series and it so compelling like the two anime kids from high school who get married compared to romances that are creepy and stalkerish with the female character being like hey stop doing that and the dude almost never does the twilight books are mess of misogyny racism and weird plots but the romance is totally believable and understandable edward is the only person to make bella feel any sort of desire and understanding no wonder she latched onto him so hard and he did with her,"If you're tired of reading romance novels with enemies to lovers tropes, rereading Twilight may be a refreshing change. Despite the misogyny and racism present in the series, the romance between Edward and Bella is believable and understandable because of how compatible they are. Their bickering evolves into an obvious mutual obsession, and Edward is the only person who understands Bella."
have never seen the show and knew close to nothing about this book before beginning ll also mention that english is not my first language and beginner reader began this book with high hopes and absolutely not trying to say that this book is bad it just that understand absolutely nothing might as well be reading german or spanish do not know either of those languages there are paragraphs that ve read multiple times but still have zero clue what it trying to say like monkey with quantum physics textbook had this exact same problem with hitchhiker guide to the galaxy started that with really huge expectations too because love sci fi but was so lost the entire time struggled with jane austen lot but literally became familiar with that very quickly and ended up enjoying all of her books very much but finished all of hitchhiker guide but cannot remember single thing it not the randomness that hard to understand it the language itself do not know why struggling with this when can read other classics and understand it pretty well for example this from good omens sometimes this sort of leaflet had little historical bit because the kind of companies that hired places like this for weekend of interactive personnel analysis or conference on the strategic marketing dynamic liked to feel that they were strategically interacting in the very building give or take couple of complete rebuildings civil war and two major fires that some elizabethan financier had endowed as plague hospital have zero clue what this paragraph means am just dumb all understood from the chapter it is from is that the characters go into this building to meet some nun and some guys start shooting at them for some reason have no clue what it all means why it supposed to be funny then they leave does anyone know if this is like different style of writing or something so can avoid it in the future or is there way to get better at understanding it all know is that both hitchhiker and good omens feel the same it not the randomness that confuses me there are dialogues and paragraphs and entire pages where feel like reading different language edit thank you so much for explaining guys looks like not at the level where can understand these books also do not have any knowledge about british culture so the satire is lost on me just want to say that was not at all trying to bash these books ve been trying to improve my english and believed was making progress but these books made me feel like had learned nothing so had to ask for my peace of mind,"The book the reader is currently trying to read is too advanced for them and they're having trouble understanding it. They've had this problem with other books they've read, like ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" and ""Good Omens"", and they're not sure if it's the writing style or their own comprehension skills that are the problem. They feel like they're missing the jokes or satire because they don't understand the language or the references to British culture."
forget how came across this book whether saw movie being mentioned or it just came up under my amazon recommendations but it pretty interesting so far the author seems to be little satirical about hyper intellectualism and already know some of the story from having read little too much blurbage before read the book but it interesting about through and just had really gut wrenching moment that prompted me to post here think wanted to commiserate with someone the main character mother is older and senile she does not remember everything but she seems present her adult daughter is professional and takes care of the mother the daughter lisa is killed because someone didn like the work she was doing the cops go to the house to tell the mother her daughter is dead with the mom senility it doesn register and the mom calls the housekeeper to make sure that the information is registered properly then the mom just walks upstairs like nothing happened and this after learning that the adult daughter who has been taking care of her for years has been killed but it just doesn get through the mom dementia it was really gut wrenching really sad,"You are reading a book that you either discovered through its movie adaptation or through Amazon recommendations. You find it interesting so far, especially how the author seems to satirize hyper intellectualism. You have read some blurbage and already know the storyline, including the tragic death of the protagonist's mother, who suffers from dementia. Her death doesn't phase the mother, who is already senile and forgetful, which you find incredibly sad."

recently had friend say about american psycho this is gay man writing about toxic masculinity read it at university and hated it found it pretentious and one note we read it as satire of mainly materialism and consumerism but in the tater tot age toxic masculinity rang more of bell mean pretentious one note bell but still has that ever happened to you,"Your friend hated reading 'American Psycho' at university because he thinks it is a one-note satire of toxic masculinity and materialism/consumerism, which he finds pretentious.  You disagree and think it also resonates in the theme of toxic masculinity."
was finishing stephen king book the long walk and was so bored skimmed to the end thought the themes were interesting so why did not care about what happened to anyone realised did not relate to the main character and more so just did not like any characters and this is true across all his books did not finish the stand because hated everyone in it highly enjoyed the action and overall loved the book but did not care for the main character some of his other books did not finish long time ago his characters are very male and very american and being neither find it hard to relate to their perspectives and thought patterns but have not found this issue with other authors and ve read lot of chuck palahniuk have never been emotionally grabbed by stephen king character can anyone relate am wondering if have picked up the wrong books or if should take it to mean he not my style and should stop bothering with him is he consistent across his books,"You feel you can't relate to the characters in Stephen King's books because they are very male, very American and you find it hard to relate to their perspectives and thought patterns. You've enjoyed the plot and action of his books but wish you could connect more with the characters.

ve gone back to school to take new turn in my career have to read quite lot for my courses and my projects although it is super interesting had not read book for pleasure for myself since spring or early summer last week found myself in book store browsing the books in english picked up book started reading few pages the back confirmed it was ya bought it finished it over the weekend actually think read something like pages yesterday read post earlier this week about defining what ya is and many people said that it was mostly about teenagers and that the language style was easier to read think this what helped me finish it it was very easy to read english not being my native language did not find the vocabulary challenging now talking about how easy reading was definitely not saying that it was dumb the book read was ace of spades by faridah abik iyimid in which she tackles racism homophobia and bullying usually read about books year but not in felt like was stalling even if my tbr is quite loaded think ll definitely turn to ya again for now it feels like an achievement and it makes me want to pick up book from my tbr,The narrator has started reading young adult (YA) books again after finding it difficult to read for pleasure while studying for their career change. They found the book Ace of Spades by Faridah AbikIyimid easy to read and appreciate the handling of serious topics like racism and homophobia in a style that is more accessible to teenagers. Reading this book has motivated them to pick up their TBR list again.
recently finished viktor frankl book man search for meaning and it was clearly not an easy read but gave huge number of lessons the best lesson learnt was we cannot control everything but we can control how we feel about it even bad situation can still find good like in camp he used to see sunrise and think beautiful or even the jokes he made with friends in extreme hunger and cold although there are many quotes that loved in this book but this one is something that want to remind myself everyday to stay composed and calm everything can be taken from man but one thing the last of the human freedoms to choose one attitude in any given set of circumstances how was your experience reading this book,"You recently finished reading Viktor Frankl's book, Man's Search for Meaning, which you found to be a tough read but rewarding as it taught you that you can't control everything that happens in life, but you can control your attitude towards it. You particularly loved the quote, ""Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances,"" as it reminds you to stay composed and calm every day, regardless of the circumstances."
and feel like was the first year could refer to myself as an avid reader finally built habit for reading after being turned off by it by school now that in career love reading purely for fun and discovering my tastes ve also been reflecting on how my reading journey will evolve as get older curious to know your reading journey have you been lifelong reader or is this also relatively new hobby have your tastes evolved how so know my title says but maybe younger readers can also enlighten me if they have an answer to this question,I have recently gotten into reading for pleasure after being discouraged from it by my prior education. I am interested in hearing about others' experiences with reading. Have you always been a reader? How has your taste in reading material changed over time? Share your stories!
wow thought the book was dark to begin with but after part when kia describes the disiase that tobey had and introduced the dynamic that andrew and leila believed that max had it that theme of doom and gruesomeness was intense to read and then the twists right after thought the book was wrapping up sheer genius on kia part almost didn finish it after the messed up start to part three,"The book starts off dark, describing a disturbing disease that Toby has and the fear that Max might have it too. The theme gets even more intense in the following parts when the true nature of Max's disease is unveiled, and when the book seems to wrap up, Kia manages to surprise the reader with a twisted ending."
as an avid reader my love for books runs deep if you share my passion you understand the exhilaration of discovering an extraordinary book that becomes impossible to set aside such finds are rare for me but this particular one exceeded my expectations the characters were captivating and the storyline drew me in completely completing the book leaves me with sense of melancholy knowing it will be considerable while before encounter another that resonates with me in such profound way,This reader is expressing their love for books and the joy they get from discovering a great book. They were captivated by the story and the characters and feel sad that it will be a long time before they find another book that they connect with as deeply.
think like the book ending little more like how lecter was gazing at the orion constellation and describing what he saw and then the very last sentence of the book but the face on the pillow rosy in the firelight is certainly that of clarice starling and she sleeps deeply sweetly in the silence of the lambs gave me chills when first read it lol such great ending to great book the movie ending was also really good,"The ending of the book, Silence of the Lambs, gave you chills when you first read it because it was so great. You especially liked the way Lecter was looking at the Orion constellation and describing it, before the last sentence revealing it was Clarice Starling sleeping peacefully. You also thought the movie ending was good."
just finished reading catcher in the rye never read it in high school and it had the biggest switch up for me of any book ve ever read spent the majority of the book hating holden and everything he was saying or doing which guess is the point but the final chapters easily recovered the entire book for me would really love to hear other people thoughts on this,"You probably missed the point of Catcher in the Rye if you didn't hate Holden Caulfield at some point during your reading of it. The novel is acclaimed for its realistic portrayal of human behavior and emotions, and Holden's character development throughout the story is a major part of that. It's common for readers to empathize with Holden's struggles early in the story, then grow frustrated with his actions as it progresses, and finally forgive him in the end due to understanding his circumstances and internal struggles. 

Would you like me to help you find discussions online about this book? I can also help you write a review if you'd like to share your thoughts with others.

christ that was good finished the fall of hyperion that same night may have sacrificed few hours of sleep but totally worth it characters were top notch immediately liked the consul and col kassad most of all and they only got better as it went on the pilgrims are definitely one of my favorite casts of characters in sci fi the world building was incredible it wasn horribly long book but by the end had whole picture of this world and it was full of those little details that make it interesting lived in the plot was great multiple plot threads all going the same place but never feeling like they were stalling to wait for one to catch up the mystery was great drip fed answers while holding plenty of twists in reserve some coming as surprise some not which is not bad thing with the groundwork being laid so well also appreciated how many guns chekhov left lying around this story overall absolutely adored hyperion it now placing in my top sci fi list and creeping up the scale in my general literature list curious as to what some of your thoughts on it are,"The reader finished 'The Fall of Hyperion' and really enjoyed it, citing the intriguing characters, the world building, the plot, the mystery, and the way guns were incorporated into the story as aspects of the book they appreciated. They are curious about others' thoughts on the book."
big ken follett fan his prose is simple but beautiful and he master at bringing you into setting and immersing you entirely common critcism is that all of his books are pretty much the same which is somewhat true but some have better mastery of the formula than others wanna talk about them briefly in the order read them pillars of the earth this is the best one to start with think it his most famous book and the one you ll see criticized on books most often there is dumb moment in the first chapter that rightfully criticized but if you get past that think the book is wonderful it has great characters it violent and engaging and the ending is extremely cathartic my main criticism would be that the book does follow pattern of bad guys make plan good guys foil it good guys have success bad guys ruin it especially for book this long it can make it rather repetitive william is great villain but he is surpassed by many of ken follet other villains world without end to me this is follett best book by mile it has the same blueprint of pillars of the earth but executed better on all levels the characters are better the time period is more interesting black plague and the plot advances constantly instead of repeating to me this book is the most memorable for characters and plot beats and read it during covid so it was great to see all the parallels to modern days there were anti maskers people who did not want to quarantine for the good of the economy religious fervor making bad decisions in the face of science caris is one of my favorite characters ever and this book has the most investing romance godwyn and ralph are also excellent antagonists eye of the needle ve been more inclined to follett historical fiction than his spy thrillers but this is still great book it short but engaging the two subplots come together in very satisfying way by the end not much to say it an unambitious book that does what it tries to do fall of giants the first of the century trilogy trilogy of follet books to cover the th century definitely more of lean on history than fiction and the characters are not as memorable as other books in the past but follett handles the scope of the world well and if you re interested in the world war time period he gives pretty enthralling look at the beats of history winter of the world this one focuses on world war ii at parts this is the best of the century trilogy but overall it average the german plotline is the best by far and the rest of the book kind of feels flatter as result the characters in this one and the following book really are not that memorable there brief plotline where the characters find out disabled people are being covertly killed by the government but overall the holocaust is completely absent from the book which feels like major oversight but it still emotional at points and pretty horrifying to know how close the world was to falling into fascism and that that still fight we have to have today there gay romance in this book the first for pov characters but in my memory of it was more cringey than great addition also one of them dies for cheap moment of drama edge of eternity the third book in the century trilogy and his worst book good god this is boring love the cold war and this era of history but he does not even cover that in any exciting way really cannot understate how dreadfully boring this book is half of it is focused on fucking rock band of all things if you hate ken follett this is the book that ll support your arguments the best it to follett what tenet is to christopher nolan almost feeling like parody at points at this point in the series the plot was lost completely and would ve rather he had characters from the first and second books as the pov characters rather than whole new set george is the one exception because of the need to have perspective on the civil rights movement dangerous fortune this is his best book next to world without end mickey and augusta are follett best villains and they re both in the same book the only real knock have is that the main character and his love interest are boring but the plot is enthralling and book about banking of all things kept me engaged and my heart pumping there is prominent gay romance in this story and without spoiling absolutely loved how it incorporates into the plot column of fire the third kingsbridge book this one is criticized lot but quite like it pierre is another masterful villain and there are some really memorable sections like when he trying to discreetly get rid of baby it dark and hilarious but legitimately suspensful where the book fails is its predicability but there lot of worthwhile stuff here however the climax with pierre and how he meets his end is dreadfully unsatisfying and you could see it coming from mile away the evening and the morning the kingsbridge prequel thought this one was good as well not very special bit derivative but no real problems either the stakes are lower than usual and the scope is not as wide but still found myself rooting for the characters and their happy endings bit of missed opportunity to incorporate the vikings more into the plot and think if follett spent year leaving this book in the oven it could ve been really special overall it fine bonus never dnf modern day spy thriller might go back to this one and only maybe finished of it but it really was not grabbing me in any strong way armor of light the fifth book about kingsbridge or sequel to column of fire it takes place during the french revolution and quite liked this one the characters are all mostly likable some bit bland and besides the battle of waterloo at the end the events feel much more personal to the daily lives of the characters as it was in the first two books instead of recounting of major historical characters there prominent gay romance in this book and it well done finally there no bury your gays trope either thankfully hornbeam is pretty great villain overall very simple and ultimately just businessman but his chapters were generally the most fun the ultimate climax with him was pretty satisfying in the end who else is big ken follet fan which of his books is your favorite,"Ken Follett is a master at bringing his readers into the setting of his books and immersing them entirely. He is criticized for using the same formula for all of his books: Good guys vs. bad guys, with the bad guys creating a plan and the good guys foiling it. However, some of his books are better at concealing this formula than others. Fall of Giants is the first book in Follett's Century Trilogy, which covers the events of the 20th century. It is a historical fiction book that focuses on the world war era and includes a gay romance."
as the cover says this book is new york times bestseller which according to various online sources roughly means that the ny times listed it once looked it up in april the author phrased her thoughts on extremely important topics climate change male female inequality violence survival the plot runs along three threads rose the story of new girl who comes among prostitutes named after flowers we can get to know her life and destiny her character has been developed the deepest in the book grant the rich young man who wants to rebel against his parents and social rules unfortunately neither his character nor his plot became very interesting often wanted to turn the page when he started to suffer too much the white alice idealistic researchers work on an isolated base find themselves in conflict situation and forced to make decisions some of which turn out to be morally objectionable but when you think about it it is difficult to find different way out of their situation real drama real icy mad max atmosphere the plot really picks up in the last third of the book the threads that have been left open until then are sewn up the violence rages despite the erotic theme the text does not contain explicit sex scenes this is not that kind of book similar to the action movies of the nineties the image focuses on the lamp during sensitive moments despite the stereotyped characters and their sometimes illogical actions this is brilliantly drawn near future one cannot argue with the important points formulated in the novel we can feel the effects of both climate change and migration on our skin even now the final intertwining of the three strands is not big bang but the original concept itself and the ideas raised are particularly interesting and provocative it is worth reading thinking and talking about it,"The book is a New York Times bestseller, which according to the online definition means it was listed by the NY Times once, and according to the review, it presents three plot lines, following the story of a new girl among prostitutes, a rich guy rebelling against his parents and social rules, and researchers working on an isolated base who find themselves in a morally questionable situation. Despite violent and erotic themes, the review emphasizes that the book does not contain explicit sex scenes. The novel presents a brilliantly drawn near future, raising important and provocative ideas about the effects of climate change and migration on society."
for example for me it is in the faithful and the fallen by john gwinn corban is being taught magic and we get glimpse of his raw power at one stage but then his lessons just stop and he never learns it and it not even mentioned again beyond brief statement about how death has made the woman teaching him too sad to continue faithful and the fallen is probably in my top but have never understood why gwynne made that choice and do not like it,"You are wondering why John Gwynne did not develop Corban's magical training further in ""Faithful and the Fallen"", citing an instance in which Corban's mentor becomes too saddened by personal loss to continue teaching him, and Corban himself never pursues learning magic beyond that point. You do not understand Gwynne's choice and find it unsatisfying."
just finished book which left things ambiguous by ending abruptly the protagonist was on his way to meet his family with surprise for christmas that showed the protagonist growth as character in big way and it was clear the family would be happy wife would be proud it would be lovely moment etc but we didn get to see all that it just ended with him in the car felt super frustrated cause know how it would ve gone there was clear evidence but wanted the author to show me wanted to get to see it was surprised at myself since normally really like ambiguous endings but guess not this kind exactly like the kind where you see the final scene but it can be interpreted one of two ways enjoy the ambiguity although deep down usually have my mind made up about what think really did happen just curious how everyone else feels since sitting here miffed with an about the author page staring at me doesn help that it was an ebook and my percent progress bar wasn working,You just finished a book and you are frustrated because the ending was ambiguous and abrupt. The protagonist was on his way to meet his family for Christmas with a surprise that showed his growth as a character. You are curious about how others feel about the ending and you are disappointed that you couldn't see how the story concluded because you are aware of how it would have ended.
there are bunch of little free libraries in my neighborhood trying to declutter bit have bunch of graphic novels for mature audiences that not sure about leaving in lfl not talking about actual porn mean things like preacher saga irredeemable invincible it good but it still has lot of bloody violence and sex in it am being puritanical to even worry about it does it matter where the lfl is how close to school,"You are concerned about the content of some of the graphic novels you want to donate to Little Free Libraries in your neighborhood and whether they are appropriate for placement near schools. The novels you mention contain violent and sexual content. 

It is hard to say whether you should be concerned without knowing the specific libraries you are talking about. Little Free Libraries are meant for a variety of readers from children to adults, but often children do browse them. Graphic novels with content unsuitable for children should ideally be placed in areas where only adults or older teens can access them. However, it is also important to note that libraries have varying policies on what can be placed in Little Free Libraries, and you should prioritize those policies over your own judgement. 

Ultimately, it is up to you to decide what content you feel comfortable donating to Little Free Libraries and whether you want to investigate the libraries further to make sure your donations align with their mission and policies."
hey fellow book lovers just had to share how my kindle has completely transformed my reading experience as someone who used to cherish the feel of physical books was skeptical at first but now cannot imagine going back since the end of june ve devoured over books thanks to the kindle the speed at which can breeze through pages is incredible and the freedom to read anywhere is game changer plus no more straining my eyes at night it like personal library that adapts to my schedule if you re on the fence about making the switch highly recommend giving the kindle shot it been total life changer for this book enthusiast happy reading,"The narrator has embraced reading on their Kindle, which they recommend for its convenience and practicality. They can read faster on their Kindle and can read anywhere, anytime, without straining their eyes. The narrator has read over 50 books on their Kindle since June."
does anyone have any opinions on which is better does it depend on the type of book was thinking about how binging tv shows tends to make me remember the show worse and or impacts me less than if spread it out but this is probably because shows were meant to be experienced weekly across years and modern shows don have that same problem books do have chapters which might seem to best fit for reading across sessions but they re still typically one story was thinking on how remember the movie watching experience more because it one sitting so didn know how if that may impact my memories on books and the reading experience too edit maybe the better question isn really one sitting but in weekend dedicating time to the one book instead or other books or hobbies,"Binging on TV shows has a different effect on the brain than reading a book in a sitting versus reading over a longer period of time. People remember shows less and the experience is different than the intended weekly release that TV shows were designed for. Books also have chapters, which may lead to thinking that reading in sessions is the best way to go, however, it may still have an impact on how the reader absorbs and remembers the story.  Reading a book in a weekend dedicated solely to reading may be another matter altogether."
tw pe sa self harm child abuse etc went into this book simply expecting it to have lot of gore as that was all had heard from friend but can say now that was surprised somewhat pleasantly for context do not do well with gore and any form of sexual abuse and whatnot think this is mostly because have very imaginative mind especially when read picture everything happening so you can see how that would be problem when reading books with heavier topics this book was indeed very difficult read for me if had to give you range say it was more difficult than tender is the flesh and less difficult than little life know that huge margin but could not find anything else to compare it to think part of why it was also bit mentally heavy for me was because of the religious guilt on display recently ve become more aware of the fact that do carry quite bit of religious guilt myself religious upbringing and education throughout the first years of my childhood this made me feel kind of shitty for relating to some of the things that the characters were feeling almost every character in this book is shitty person and did not want to be relating to them at all but ll get to that later that being said think the writing was absolutely brilliant and meaningful lapvona begins by narrating marek and jude lives and could not help but find myself sympathizing with marek and hating jude at the beginning guess what appealed to me about marek was the fact that could blame jude for all that was wrong with him their view on religion felt like hyper saturated version of all religious belief systems their obsession with pain suffering modesty poverty and all things shitty about our world in hopes of being repaid in death rings bell does not it of course the themes of capitalism power and corruption did not go over my head either found myself comparing the priest and villiam deal quite similar to europe in the middle ages and current day iraq even where live it very sad but it is what it is will go character by character and try to dissect my thoughts little bit though marek later in the story my thoughts of marek kept changing felt bad for him because it really was not his fault that he was brought up to be shitty person but he was shitty person he was being abused by jude all throughout his childhood he was denied mother and ina the one person she went to for comfort was actually downright molesting him then his mother hated him which do not blame her for but he was not to blame either marek was the target of blame and hatred for almost everyone in this book and although he was not completely blameless did find myself feeling bad for him marek never knew love from anyone it was the one thing he craved and he never got it his fixation on needing to be loved almost made him immune to all other feelings he never actually felt guilty for killing jacob even loved how this character was written it did invoke great deal of thought but do not think have completely understood his purpose yet ll need some more time to think about it jude jude was the worst never felt second of empathy for him he raped agata when she was just child and yet judged her for trying to leave him his hatred for marek was completely unjustified and so was his abuse do not really have much to say about him except that he seemed like good representation of large amount of people who seem to fixate on modesty and rejection of beauty when this is only an attempt at fighting their own urges and their own lust his repression of his sexuality and his self harm were all attempts to fill void within him even his obsession with sheep felt like compensation for his lack of children think he knew marek was not his and that why he hated him or maybe he hated him because he looked like his mother do not know jacob could not feel bad for jacob when he died but felt bad for luka dibra and lispeth lispeth inner dialogue was quite concerning too and did not like her either but those few pages that described her grief and relationship with jacob absolutely tore me apart she did not know better and can only be glad that she died painlessly ina ina character at first felt wholesome but then as soon as that shit with marek was revealed it was over for me briefly found her story with gregor to be strangely sensical but just could not find it in me to like her at all and to me her character was clinging on to life for seemingly no reason can not imagine why anyone would want to live so much she was strange and do not think have figured out her character either villiam almost felt bad for villiam but he was tyrant so did not really feel bad for him he was just so stupid do not really have much thought on his character either but would love to hear what other people think overall do not think have thought about this book enough right now think there was probably lot that missed but loved it despite the horrible shit in here think it was very well written and thought invoking story since none of my friends have read this am curious to hear what others who have read it think of it and cannot go anywhere else to discuss,"The book deals with difficult and heavy topics, such as self-harm, abuse, and religion. The narrator describes changing feelings towards the characters, ultimately empathizing with some of them, but hating others. Despite identifying the characters as horrible people, the writing is described as brilliant and thought-provoking. The narrator is curious about others' thoughts on the book."
thinking it might be fun to set book count goal and pick specific books for it ve set number goals for few years but just read random books whatever is available at the library but want to set curated list for to make sure get good mix of genres challenges and just for fun anyone do this if so please share your book list and process of choosing,The bot is considering setting a book count goal and planning out the books to read towards it.

been thinking about this bit and wondering if it ever truly happened is there series you ve read where the last book is the best one personally can think of plenty of trilogies where the second book is the best one and even more where the first book is the best one but the last book as the best one drawing blank also tagging this spoilers because want details damn it will read things regardless of spoilers or not please be aware there can be spoilers around discussion is there book series where the last book is the best one why is that last book the best and more general why do you think the last book is so often the worst or at least subpar after all in book the climax is usually the most interesting part so why is not that true for whole series also feel free to rant about series where the last book is not the best one as long as you explain what it did poorly maybe we can reverse engineer what good last book should be like lol ll try to reply to as many people as can,Book series where the last book is the best one. Why do you think the last book is often the worst? How do you think a last book should be written to be the best one? Book spoilers ahead.
just finished the andromeda strain and enjoyed everything up until the end just felt very abrupt and left me wondering why the trooper had delayed reaction to the organism understand what the baby and old man stayed alive but the trooper had delayed reaction wouldn his diabetes ph balance have killed the organism like it did for the baby and old man why did he experience the insanity from the organism later,"You are wondering why the soldier in The Andromeda Strain suffered a delayed reaction to the organism, and why his diabetes and pH balance did not kill the organism like it did for the baby and the old man.

final warning do not read this if you haven finished the book as it will spoil the entire story for you sorry for the excessive spoils warnings ve never made post like this and was to be extra cautious lmao hi just got done reading flowers for algernon what an amazing book was little confused by some parts though what is the magic powder that charlie has at the end he found it in some books and thought it would make him smart what happens to charlie at the end does he commit suicide assuming that what happened to algernon does he end up in group home pretty confused would be tidy or not don remember so good please if you get chanse put some flowrs on algernons grave in the bak yard,"Charlie finds a magic powder that he believes will make him smart, at the end of the book Flowers for Algernon. Charlie commits suicide and Algernon dies prematurely, both likely due to their sudden increase in intelligence.

just finished good bad girl by alice feeney and am done the whole thing was bunch of characters who knew what was going on and simply would not tell the reader they all had places to go and things to do without ever saying why they were doing it it led to conversations that were stilted and unbelievable because they were not speaking like any normal person does am so sick of it it is not suspenseful or intriguing it is lazy it seems having an unreliable narrator these days is cheap lazy way to keep your plot mysterious when you know there really is not anything happening and it could all reasonably be wrapped up if that person just simply said what was going on and why they were doing what they were doing prefer mysteries and thrillers where can piece the clues together not just some main character in first person withholding information they already know rant over,You just finished reading Good Bad Girl by Alice Feeney and you're frustrated that the characters know more than they let on and have conversations that are not believable. You're tired of unreliable narrators being used as a plot device to create mystery when there isn't any. You prefer mysteries and thrillers that allow you to piece together clues rather than having information withheld from you.
ll go first love lessons and the girls series from jacqueline wilson why tf was reading these when was feel like the reason why loved love lessons so much when was younger is because had daddy issues and don even get me started on the girls series why was nadine with an year old guy and ellie dad as well bro what just re read these books yesterday and now literally discombobulated how did my parents take one look at these books and think such child friendly book for my child in year should not have been reading these books at that age,"You enjoyed Love Lessons by Jacqueline Wilson when you were younger because you could relate to it due to having daddy issues.

this book is my safe place have read it once year since bought it years ago the cover is creased the pages are yellowing but love it it has travelled the world with me to me the story never falters the way that dumas describes human nature through the count observations is just amazing in particular la mazzolata the way that each character has fleshed out enough introduction and back story to make them feel like main character really pulls me in to the point that never really miss the count in the chapters that he is not in everyone carries the story wonderfully every time read different parts of the story hit in different ways depending on how am at the the counts actions change how feel about him every read through find myself looking at them from different angles and points it really feels like reading different book each time know the story inside out but still find new things to get me thinking each time read it love this book it is my safe space will never stop reading it if you have not already give it try edit to add the version ve got is the penguin classic robin buss english translation,"This book has been my safety blanket for years. I've read it once a year since I bought it. Although the cover is creased and the pages are yellowed, I love it.

This book just pulls you in."
lot of people say they like to get into reading but don know how and think the best advice could give for those people is to approach it as you would physical exercise some people can run marathon yet it through training over long period of time which gets them to that point if you want to read huge book you re going to need to read it in short bursts or start off on short stories first the other thing is that if you can run then you should walk approach small texts and take your time but try to work on spacing your reading sessions out used to only read on the night and then not throughout the day so my comprehension suffered you should practice putting book down then picking it back up after ten minutes it takes more self will than just reading for an hour straight or something and you re physically training yourself to be able to pick the book up at any time also read multiple books at once find you should have fun book maybe one you ve read before which you can read before picking up the text you need to tackle it gets you into the mindset of reading itself but reading the harder text will be better because of this approach think of it like going from warm water to hot water rather than just jumping into boiling hot shower really want more people to read so if you have questions don hesitate to ask,"If you're contemplating a large book, read it in doses, like snacking on chapters or short stories, or read multiple books at once. Reading should be approached as an exercise in stamina and discipline. By reading multiple books at once, you can stay engaged with the reading process, enhance your comprehension, and improve your ability to pivot between different writing styles. Reading should be fun, so if you want to start reading don't hesitate to reach out for advice or suggestions."
lately find that handful of authors and writers do not like to call their dystopian novels dystopian you can blame it on ya and pretentiousness not wanting to be labeled genre fiction even though strongly believe there no demerit that comes with that classification instead these are called speculative fiction and never science fiction granted science fiction has certain requirements in my mind since it so oversaturated with recycled storylines and worlds think lot has been lost in dystopian literature there less experimentation as the most profitable and generally appealing dystopian books are dominating the genre maybe because it is not so new anymore it not as thought provoking and profound as it once was when think of classic dystopian novels there only handful that comes to mind if think about science fiction as whole there are loads more notable titles that come to mind think associations with dystopia have changed lot since the influx of ya dystopian trilogies while not criticizing these books they made up the better part of my youth trust me wonder what happened to dystopian books that were so good they were considered true classics the only one that comes to mind is the handmaid tale but atwood has already made some comments about her feelings on the classification most of which interpreted as slap in the face to science fiction writers love dystopian books new and old but find lot of new works to be so repetitive and lacking in depth let me know what you think about the direction of dystopian books,"Some writers and authors nowadays tend not to label their works as dystopian, probably due to pretentiousness or because they don't want to be labeled as genre writers. Nowadays, dystopian novels are less experimental, and there are much more notable titles in science fiction than in dystopian literature. Do you happen to know what happened to the good old-fashioned dystopian novels? 

Were they simply overshadowed by the influx of young adult dystopian trilogies? Or do you think it is just a natural evolution of a literary trend? Share your thoughts with us!"
do not want to display them on my shelf but also paid good chunk of my allowance to buy them throwing them away is out of the question since live in dorm space is luxury so usually end up lending them away to friends and hope they forget to return them told my friend about this few days ago and she said it the weirdest way she ever heard of someone trying to get rid of their books,"I don't want to display my books that I bought with my allowance, but I don't have the space to keep them. I lend them to my friends but they never give them back. My friend thinks my method of getting rid of them is weird."
reading the good earth for the first time about pages from the end and ve totally lost interest in it was very interested at the start the writing is so different ve never read anything else by buck so do not know if it her style or if this is the way that she choosing to present these characters as way of presenting chinese characters to western audience got really involved with the story imagined real deep love between wang lung and lan an unspoken love as neither was the type to say such things but real connection based on partnership so you can imagine my surprise when lotus was introduced and it turns out that love was only in my imagination at least on wang lung part we re never told from lan point of view not only did he not feel any tenderness for her but he was repulsed by this woman who given him everything and to whom he owed so much even when lan was dying and thought he have an awakening to the fact that he truly loved her the only thing he had an awakening to was how useful she was around the house feel like he stayed with her out of guilt that everything he did was from guilt and obligation not love and caring it became clear that the direction and ending of the book is going to be that wang lung gets hold of everything the house of hwang once had their lands their house and their position in the community and his family is going to turn into them he broken the connection between his sons and the land they do not love it and his sons do not love wang lung and he does not love them all they have is cultural sense of duty to one another do not have to read the last pages to know that the sons will not care about keeping the land the writing on the wall wang lung had chance at real happiness but he was so insecure about being farmer that enough was never enough for him as side note pretty appalled about the conditions that lotus lived in she was being generously treated by having to live her entire life in three rooms and an outdoor area with foot square fish pond she had no entertainment no musicians no actors no storytellers she literally had only three people to talk with and nothing to do all day day after day month after month year after year no wonder she got fat,"The narrator is disappointed with the ending of *The Good Earth*, where the main character Wang Lung does not end up loving Lan, the wife he married out of obligation. The narrator predicts that Wang Lung will regain his family's former wealth and status, but at the cost of breaking the connection between sons and the land, and between the sons and their father. The narrator also criticizes the way Lotus, Wang Lung's second wife, is treated."
remember when the harry potter series became popular message boards and social media was filled with discussions even twilight fans were constantly talking about the series on tumblr suppose asoif got there because of the tv series wondering if there current book or book series with similar level of mass appeal leading to obsessive online discussions fact finding easter eggs digging and so on,The Harry Potter series is likened to the TV show Game of Thrones (based on the A Song of Ice and Fire series) in its level of popularity and the ensuing online discussions about the series. Fans of both franchises were obsessive online communities that decoded mysteries and found easter eggs in the work. Do you have a favorite series presently that is as popular as these two franchises?
welcome readers over the last several weeks months we ve all seen an uptick in articles about schools towns states banning books from classrooms and libraries obviously this is an important subject that many of us feel passionate about but unfortunately it has tendency to come in waves and drown out any other discussion we obviously do not want to ban this discussion but we also want to allow other posts some air to breathe in order to accomplish this we re going to post discussion thread every month to allow users to post articles and discuss them in addition our friends at bannedbooks would love for you to check out their sub and discuss banned books there as well,"There has been an increase in articles about books being banned from schools and libraries lately, which is a discussion that passionate people feel strongly about.

so read they re gonna de orbit the iss in the next ten years into the antarctic ocean made me wanna re read neil stephensons seveneves again bad idea lol if you haven read it it one of those science fiction novels that could plausibly happen it chocked full of real scientific reality and only the plot is loosely science fiction the basic plot is the moon blows up for some reason and the chunks rain down killing all humans on earth and the story is how the survivors of the event cope prepare and carry on and it now worries me they don have the commercial moon base we are planning even sketched out before we send our off planet nest into the spaceship graveyard am paranoid tell me paranoid,The plot of Neil Stephenson's Seveneves is set in a future where the moon explodes and kills all humans on earth. The story follows how the survivors cope and attempt to continue mankind. The fact that NASA is planning to deorbit the ISS in the next ten years and that there is no indication of a commercial moon base being planned worries the narrator.
to be clear not asking which writers books you prefer rather the way they write their stories in general if had to describe each writer style say tolkien is more correct while herbert is more rebellious remember reading somewhere that tolkien hinted at some point that he disliked the way herbert wrote the dune series which does make sense since he was university teacher and knew how to bend and twist the english language to his will while really like tolkien world and books in general adore herbert writing style many times had to read twice or more some sentences because they were so grammatically dense if someone here studies or is very involved in literature can correct me if wrong but think herbert writing is fantastic not because it is correct but perhaps many times it is not you ll never find wrong sentence in tolkien books everything is polished and sparkling and everytime read one of his books everything was very easy to read which again makes complete sense since his books were aimed for every age what do you guys think would love to hear your thoughts,The writer prefers the style of Tolkien because it is more correct and polished whereas Herbert's style is more rebellious and grammatically dense. Tolkien was a university teacher and knew how to manipulate the English language. You can't go wrong with either writer although their styles are different. Herbert's style is fantastic even if it is not always correct.
have no doubt this has been posted here million times recently tried to get back into reading nearly and have not read book start to finish for almost years looked up some recommendations for captivating short stories and ordered few flowers for algernon was the first started this morning maybe hours ago finished it minutes before writing this post and have not stopped crying since why was this so impactful the entirety of the last pages was in tears and had to stop several times in shock at how much it affected me emotionally guess this is review of sorts would recommend this book to anyone and now looking forward to reading my second book please if you get chanse put some flowrs on algernons grave in the bak yard,"The user has recently started reading again after not having read a book from start to finish in years.

for now after watching the entire show have planned on reading the books for years finally had time to start the journey and can do it first of all got to point where could only read about fifty pages day because it was so depressing that it was actually making me sad and angry to read it got about of the way and realized was never going to finish this book nor was going to read the sequels think had picked up this series before the show aired would have loved them but as it stands because know the major beats of the story am just miserable the whole time waiting for all the awful things know are going to happen there is no surprise anymore no shock when there is betrayal or death yes the books are not exactly the same as the show and they diverge at certain point but just can do it can read book that makes me dread opening it just to say did it is well written and compelling but think it time to return it to the library for someone who will actually enjoy reading it edit the lack of surprise is not from having seen the show it from knowing at any point someone you ve enjoyed reading about is going to die or do something horrible to someone else it exhausting to read about horrific things over and over and over,"After starting to read the book series that the show is based on, the reader is finding it hard to enjoy the story because of how depressing it is, and they feel like they already know what is going to happen because of the show, removing any surprises from the reading experience."
so beautiful world where are you was my first sally rooney book and finished it about months ago adored it in so many ways loved the characters and seeing how they struggled in world that is more or less doomed by the climate crisis loved how they struggled in their relationships and their way of communicating with each other heavily related to alice problems in opening up and seeming cold to others as well as eileen paragraph where she is talking about how she used to find happiness in very mundane things but somehow lost the ability to do that as well as her fear that she is standing in the way of her own happiness because she pities herself too much and every time something good happens to her she questions how long it will last sometimes the emails or the way the characters were thinking was like was reading my own thoughts and it was so cathartic for me this book was very easy stars and the book kept coming back into my mind so wanted to see what other people think of it but looking through reddit the only threads found were from people who did not like the book for various reasons and it made me kind of sad completely understand that some people may not like the lack of plot or how the characters are bad at communicating with each other but on the other hand found that it was just very realistic depiction of life lot of people say the characters are unlikable but found that they were just flawed in very believable and human way is that just reddit thing that people disliked this book so much honestly seeing so many people say the characters are not likable makes me feel kind of weird since relate to them so much what do you guys think about this,"The book So Beautiful and World, Where Are You by Sally Rooney was the first book by this author that OP read and they loved it. They loved how realistic the characters were, even though some people find them unlikable. They also enjoyed how the book explored the climate crisis and relational struggles.

if you like liked goosebumps and or scary stories to tell in the dark you ll love the weenies series do not let those silly anthropomorphic frankfurters on the cover fool you these books are pure nightmare fuel and that pretty much all can say without spoiling any of the stories just frustrated that nobody seems to talk about them at least not as much as the other two series brought up ve only read couple of them and they are underrated as hell if you go on youtube and look up goosebumps audiobook or scary stories to tell in the dark reading you ll get satisfactory list of results however if you try that with the weenies series you ll only get handful of results why tf are these books so obscure,"Although they may appear harmless with their silly covers, the Weenies series of books are just as scary as Goosebumps and Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, but far less talked about. This frustrates the reviewer, who argues that these books are nightmare fuel and deserves more popularity and discussion."
was thinking about how sometimes basically read the same book over and over again obviously by different authors and the stories are different but the core the trope is the same and never get bored of it for me it the strong woman the outcast even that fights for herself because people don really understand where she is coming from maybe feel seen and not alone when read them or maybe see that other people have similar or worse struggles for some reason as disturbing as the stories might be find them really comforting and wonder why always turn to them maybe you guys have similar experiences,"You enjoy reading about strong women who are outcasts and must fight for themselves, because you feel seen and not alone when reading about characters who have similar or worse struggles than you. You find dark comfort in these stories."
just finished child of god by cormac mccarthy over the course of flights holy hell was that ride absolutely love brutal horror and this book was rough usually struggle to read much more than few pages at time but couldn put this book down it was incredibly fascinating and brutal edit apparently didn discuss the book enough for this post to remain active in the subreddit my apologies this book felt really weird compared to lot of movies ve seen honestly one of the things that struck me as was reading was how some of the turning points in the book like when lester kills his friends daughter really freaked me out and actually shocked me in way don think movie could have if that scene were to happen in movie feel like would have seen it coming or like wouldn have been as shocked for whatever reason there were lot of moments like that in this book that thought about when lester kills the couple after finding them trying to have sex in their car when greer shoots lester arm off when lester begins cross dressing and collecting corpses in the cave it all impacted me in way movie never really has really enjoy this style of narration too along with the fact that mccarthy doesn seem to use quotation marks which really threw me off at first don know if this is what all of his books are like but think might try blood meridian next really like this style of gruesome horror usually really good about being able to stomach any themes in horror but when it heavily involving sexual related horror find that stuff really hard to get through it just so dark and depraved but there is an element of morbid curiosity that gets me to wonder what drives man to behave like that overall phenomenal book ll definitely be on the hunt for more books from here on out,"The book was tough to put down, depicting gruesome and shocking events that impacted the reader in a way that a movie never could. The style of narration, alongside the lack of quotation marks, created a unique reading experience. The reader is curious for more books by this author, especially Blood Meridian, despite often having difficulty getting through themes of sexual-related horror."
feel like im enjoying reading comics more than do books im book lover started reading obviously with books with plain text wrote books when was little for fun and love reading just plain text but im starting to like reading comics especially manga japanese graphic novels and webtoons can be considered manhwa too because is mostly from south korea more than reading books with plain texts im starting to prioritize reading comic books over plain text books do not know if im starting to lose concentration when reading books with plain text but reading comic books is so much faster and comfortable for me maybe it is because do not have to be imagining the texts on my mind because every scene every character every situation every thought and every move is drawn beautifully in those pages depending on the artist have read some comics where the artstyle is just bad doing everything for me while enjoy the story not only reading graphic novels is faster is better visually and you get to remember chapters more easily because every image and customized text is in your brain another thing really enjoy about manga and most asian comics specifically is that the author writter is the one drawing the pages too they are the artist and the writer that makes me feel more connected and closer with the creator of the book am reading with western comics is little different because there usually the writer and different person doing the drawing for the pages in that case prefer manga more than western comics if it is reading comics are books too im not losing the privilege or ability of reading to read im saying this because there people that think that reading comic books graphic novels is lesser and will tell you that have read some graphic novels that are infinite times better than most of the books have read even better than some of my favorite books feel more comfortable reading with images drawings and paint art but still love books with plain texts at the end of the day but my priority on reading books like that is fading away the more read graphic novels do not know if some people are starting to feel the same way as me but have seen some booktubers and people that knew that were only about plain text books switching to manga comic books in general or reading comic books and plain text books at the same time prioritizing the two of those is happening in the entertainment industry too most entertainment companies from hollywood mostly are relying more on comic books in the present day more than in the past with superhero movies anime adaptations which come from the manga action movies lot of action movies are coming from western indie comics videogames coming from manga western anime etc comics in general are selling lot more than books too especially manga,"You prefer reading manga and other comics compared to books written with plain text alone. For you, reading comics is faster, better visually, and aids in remembering chapters. You relate more to manga since the author draws and writes them whereas in Western comics, there are two different people for writing and drawing. You are still a book lover but prioritize comics more nowadays. 
Many entertainment companies like Hollywood have been relying on comics more for content nowadays."
after completing war and peace missed tolstoy while reading other books so thought why not take death of ivan ilyich was saving it for phase in my life that is kinda spiritual asked myself why not now it is really short story and is full tolstoy he gives this vivid description of his world and we feel like we are the ones who built the house for ivan ilyich saw myself in those characters felt pity for ivan but ve been in his visitors and family position and ve done the things they did laughed at myself wondered what my fate will be and cried the greatest deception ivan and anyone else has done is to decieve himself he thought this was the right way to live to buy house to make cheap copy of higher class people working hard for more wage and he lived it he earned respect of other people who were living for their own interests as he is for his but he did not look deep inside him he did not see the abyss in him he did not ask himself why am alive what does it mean to be alive and he kept deceiving himself till he is on the verge of death gerasim is serf but knows the suffering of dying man than ivan family or ivan himself he is not in pursuit of worldly possessions he is more aware of life than anyone else in the story it was perfect timing for me to read this story and think this will be great eye opener for those who run before earthly matters to stop and reflect for moment am also aware that this feeling may not last and still might end up like ivan but want to remind myself again death is coming do not betray yourself,"The narrator recently finished War and Peace and missed Tolstoy's writing, so they picked up The Death of Ivan Ilyich, a short story they had been saving for a more spiritual stage of their life. They identified with Ivan Ilyich's character and felt pity, shame, and tears for him and his deception. The narrator reflects on the story's message that one should not betray oneself by pursuing status and wealth at the expense of personal reflection and awareness of one's own mortality. The narrator aims to remind themselves of this lesson and hopes it will also serve as an eye opener for others."
started reading regularly again and noticed most of the books enjoy are ya fiction worried it might mean not smart enough for adult books back when was reading more often about decade ago ya books used to be shorter than adult ones but now it seems that their length has greatly expanded so not clear on what sets them apart these days what the difference between them now,"You have recently taken up reading again and have noticed that you mostly read young adult (YA) fiction. You are concerned that this suggests you are not intelligent enough for adult books and wonder if there is a distinction between YA books and adult books, given that YA books have grown length-wise and whether there is a difference between the two genres."
noticed read light ya when am stressed out and need an escape tend to go dystopian or heartbreaking books when am feeling down and then wonder if it aggravates whatever emotion is weighing on my chest it kinda feels like listening to sad music when you are sad do not really remember enough to determine pattern though so was wondering what other people do do you read cheerful books when you are feeling down or do you prefer dark themed ones does it even matter or does it not influence your emotions at that moment,"When I'm stressed or feeling down, I tend to reach for heartbreaking or dystopian books. I am curious to know if other people gravitate toward books that mirror their emotions or if they seek out happier fare. Does reading content that aligns with your mood enhance or detract from the experience?"

so reading leave the world behind and think it ok it does not seem to be really going anywhere in terms of the plot outside of the protagonists having huge should stay or should go internal monologue for the majority of the story maybe just went in with the wrong expectations but went in expecting more of cabin at the end of the world scenario where we are not completely sure what happening do not know what did everyone else think,"You feel the novel, Leave the World Behind, didn't have a clear direction in terms of plot and spent too much time on the main character's internal monologue. You were looking for more of an apocalyptic story like The Cabin at the End of the World. 

Did you enjoy any parts of the book?"
opinions on where the crawdads sing feel like in the minority first thought the book was well written however did not like the book at all thought was going to love it after all the amazing reviews but was sooo disappointed felt like the nature writing was great and vivid but then it got to the point where it was just too much understood kya life and what was going on but some chapters just seemed so routine like kya goes to jumpin kya makes lunch dinner kya goes to bed next chapter was so bored was intrigued by her relationships and thought that was good and added more depth the crime trial scenes were great but they literally were only at the end of the book overall too much back and forth bland scenes and just boring,"You did not enjoy where the crawdads sing. You found the writing to be too vivid at times, and you were bored by the routine nature of some of the scenes. You were intrigued by the character relationships, and you enjoyed the crime trial scenes at the end, but they were not enough to save the book for you."
hi all know some ebooks come with interactive links and animation which make it engaging for readers and it got me thinking about paper back books love the feel of book and wonder what can be done to make these hard paper back books engaging and interesting to get new readers was thinking initially qr codes next to photos which could take reader to website but welcome any ideas just as discussion,"Some ebooks include interactive links and animations that enhance the reading experience, and have prompted thoughts about how to make paperbacks more engaging for readers. One idea is to include QR codes next to photos in paperbacks that direct readers to supplementary websites, but other ideas are welcomed to spark discussion."
non spoiler review really enjoyed this book it was well crafted story told from many points of view felt like each pov was unique and made sense for their character for the most part each character actions dialogue and thoughts were consistent with their motivations each character felt real which kept me pulled into the story also enjoyed the way she used several different levels of narrative distance depending on the pov the prose was smooth and easy to read yet compelling and interesting felt like was having conversation with well spoken person overall gave it stars spoilers thought the author did good job tying all loose ends into neat little knot by the end however did feel my suspension of disbelief stretched bit in that effort felt somewhat cheated to find out that maggie was the person who hit erin with her car and that she had been in hiding because of it the fact that she had just left her phone at home was too convenient and just did not believe her response to hitting erin to be genuine actions her character would take also the fact that the detective just gave up on finding out who hit erin was too much of cop out especially when she had been characterized so much as not believing in coincidences the author actually pointed this contradiction out which shows she expected readers might feel that way not sure get the point of leading the reader to believe erin father was the killer and then revealing it to be sam it felt like pointless twist just for the sake of twist,"The reader really enjoyed the book overall, but felt their suspension of disbelief was stretched a little too far in some parts. They appreciated the way the author crafted the story and portrayed the characters' actions and thoughts consistent with their motivations, but found convenient plot points and character actions stretched their belief of the story. They also felt the twist at the end was somewhat pointless. 

Would the reader recommend the book to others? 

Yes, despite the parts that stretched their belief, they would recommend the book to others."

assistant chosen from the nearby population every ten years this is the only book where do not recommend you read the audiobook it just really bad piranesi by susanna clarke this book is incredibly

planned book mages of the wheel series this is world where there are six houses of magic this series is heavy on political intrigue with romance subplots kushiel dart by jacqueline carey this series is set in an alternate reality france where the companions of christ like figure have become religious god like icons in their own right phedre is courtesan serving the god namaah under the tutelage

historical romance with nerdy academic female main character but in world where magical faeries exist this is the book for you deadly education by naomi novik this is the first book in trilogy set in magical school you might be tempted to compare this to harry potter or similar magical academia stories but do not this school will try to kill you master of crows by grace draven this is draven best work in my opinion half fantasy half romance martise is slave trying to win her freedom her master sorcerer of the conclave will free her if she can find incriminating evidence against renegade sorcerer silhara the master of crows historical the black madonna by stella riley this is historical epic set during the english civil wars this is my favorite book and wrote an entire rave post about this series describing why it is so excellent it is the first book in the roundheads cavaliers book series lemonade by nina pannachi this is woman mundane horror written like it is historical romance novel this book contains graphic descriptions on on page rape by the main male character who is the villain of the story do not go into this book thinking it is historical romance because it is not romance the devil in winter by lisa kleypas historical romance is my favorite kind of romance and this book is the best of its genre and tropes the parfit knight by stella riley stella riley is abslutely excellent at writing complex and flawed characters and this series is no exception go into this book completely blind to get the most out of the experience the duke of shadows by meredith duran this is historical romance that takes place in two parts years apart the first part in colonized and revolting india the second part in london years later young couple experience the horrors of war and then are separated due to particularly traumatic event they are reunited years later and have to deal with the consequences of what they experienced the duke by gaelen foley bel is ruined woman turned courtesan who gets wrapped up in the duke of hawkscliffe quest to uncover the truth about murder sci fi there is no antimemetics division by qntm this is book in the scp universe and it made me feel insane while reading it it is legitimately horrifying at certain points and it very hard to describe what this book is actually about it masterpiece of creative writing style the land of the beautiful dead by lee smith smith writes very bleak philosophical sci fi and this is their best book set in dystopian future where god like figure of death has destroyed much of humanity the first fifteen lives of harry august by claire north give north props for coming up with the most unique take on time travel ve ever read harry august is human who is reborn at the start of his life every time he dies at the end of his eleventh life little girl appears and warns him that the end of the world is coming unless harry can do something about it ender game by orson scott card do not particularly like the author but cannot deny that this is sci fi classic everyone should read horror dowry of blood by gibson this is the gothic tale of dracula as told from the perspective of his first bride constanta it is an excellent example of female rage then earth swallowed ocean by shiloh sloane this is very bloody and dark horror romance the best grittiest version of animalistic werewolves ve read written in really interesting style the sequel cracked blue sky is also very good but preferred the horror of the first book to the detective mystery of the second harrow faire series by kathryn ann kingsley this series straddles several genres horror fantasy paranormal dark romance it has some very messed up stuff in it so definitely check content warnings if you are sensitive to abusive or violent content in books cora is normal girl who goes to circus like faire one day she is tricked into becoming part of the faire itself an eternal ghostly world where the performers are semi immortal and violent formerly human creatures mystery the girl with the dragon tattoo in my opinion this is the most well crafted mystery detective novel written in the st century the very best books of this genre are ones where the reader is given enough clues that they could possibly work out the mystery on their own but you could still feasibly still be very surprised by how the plot ultimately plays out this book accomplishes that excellently the alienist this may be my favorite detective novel and it works very well with the time culture and technology constraints of the time period in which it is set the year is and new york is home to serial killer the field of criminology is new and little understood and the detective in this case is psychologist laszlo kreizler definitely read the book and do not watch the tv show based on it thriller the mindf ck series by abby lana is serial killer with mysterious background taking revenge on those who have harmed her and her family logan is an fbi agent tracking down this serial killer they cross paths without knowing who the other is this is series of very short books so they could all be read together like one larger book classics the count of monte cristo by alexandre dumas this is the single greatest revenge story ever written do not be intimidated by the length of the book and do not read shortened version every page of this book is perfect the annotated pride and prejudice by jane austen david shapard jane austen is queen of satire and romance but highly recommend the versions that include shapard annotations the additional historical context adds so much to the stories jane eyre by charlotte bronte gothic romance does not get better than this les miserables by victor hugo do you want to read historical epic and learn about french history while drowning in sea of human misery fan fiction manacled by senlinyu what if dumbledore died before he could teach harry about the horcruxes meaning the war between good and evil became that much harder and thus the good guys lose what then definitely check content warnings on this one deep dives ve written several deep dive posts about certain series love that deserve more attention than they get here they are roundheads cavaliers by stella riley mages of the wheel by evans daughter of the forest by juliet marillier hope you guys find book or two you enjoy from this list,"Here is a list of books that I personally recommend.

spotify is starting an audiobook buffet business and worried about it is spotify going to harm the book business like it did to the music industry spotify made music super accessible but paid musicians peanuts now they re doing the same thing to writers with audiobooks this is not new big tech gives all the money to the top few artists or writers leaving the rest barely scraping by it like popularity contest where the tech giants win every time starving out most creators,"Spotify is expanding into the audiobook industry. With its history of disrupting the music industry by making content extremely accessible, while paying the artists very little, Spotify worries that it might do the same with the writers of audiobooks. Big tech companies typically funnel the majority of their profits to the top handful of artists, leaving the rest of the creators fighting for the table scraps."
always on the hunt for new books and personally always head over heels for stories that tackle gritty topics and make that their central point having said that was not sure about this book as ve never heard of the author and this seems to be his first book it also did not help that the author is not native english speaker but wrote the book in english note that not saying people who are not native speakers should not write in whatever language makes them comfortable just saying that given how this looks like it was his first publishing had my doubts for context share the authors nationality we re both portuguese and saw this book at my local library but if you are in any way interested in the book believe you can order it online and there obviously always the book format which is format very much despise having said all that decided to give it shot after skimming through few loose pages on each chapter and thought why not the gist of the plot is that we follow the week of psychologist doctor heart and his interactions with the patients that he gets everyday will straight off the bat say that doctor heart schedule was not something that was on the author mind as in most days he only sees one person and then on another he sees two mind you this is just me nitpicking and it is just nitpick because the meat and potatoes is not in the realism of schedules but the problems discussed with each person for as much as english not being the author native language was doubting point for me the grammar seems fine the author clearly had different personalities in mind for each character and to my untrained eye each character does speak and act in way that realistic and most of all fun fun as in everyone has something unique to them that believable by the way as it might or might not be obvious this is very character driven story there is an overarching plot revolving around heart past and how he deals with trauma but that is sprinkled in each chapter as we read through each chapter it clear that we re starting to see much more of heart and the story eventually shifts from heart patients to heart will say that in the first chapter heart was bit of blank canvas for me at least as he just looked like the usual doctor type and was there as stand in for the audience as we found out what was wrong with each person not that there anything wrong with that was just pleasently surprised when finding out that heart did have more to his character than just doctor gives advice to patient like mentioned each character is unique mind some spoilers but if you ve read so far then believe you do not mind it there teenager struggling with suicidal tendencies and gender identity soldier who struggles with alcoholism lady who self harms and has broken heart pun not intended florist who husband commited suicide and another psychologist who suffers from anger problems each person has very diverse personalities and quite liked everyone the only person could say did not like quite as much was the teenager but maybe that because of the way the author presented their dialogue the story is told to us as if it were doctor appointment heart records the sessions with the patient permission ala ben harmon from ahs and we proceed with getting to know the patient because this is structured to feel like conversation with people who are quite emotionally unstabble for whatever reason they might have some bits of conversation feel like they re all over the place felt this mostly in the first chapter with the teenager as we ve established the teenager is suicidal and deals with gender identity issues liked that the author focused on the teen life and feelings without hammering home the point that they are suicidal or whatever thus making it feel bit more genuine because of this however the characters go from heart asking the teen how they view their own life to why they feel like their gender is not right for them to me at least this felt bit poorly structured but nevertheless still enjoyed the chapter from chapter and onward did not notice much of this whether it was because they were topics could relate to more or because the author did better job at communicating the topics do not know despite anything ve implied so far loved the characters especially the last person heart sees before the big finale it as if was talking with one of my friends and that felt awesome speaking of the finale think it where it might make or break for some people personally really liked it and shared this story before with friend of mine who suffers from the same issues the author seemed to describe in the chapter and she says that it checks out to add to this since trying not to spoil too too much she did also mention that what happens in the finale has happened to her and can happen to others like her but the severity depends from person to person nevertheless realism or lackthereof aside recommend suspending your disbelief for the finale even though did quite like it sure did horrible job on reviewing this book this was my first review and ve only discovered this sub few days ago so apologies all in all quite liked the book and feel like the topics were tackled with gentle touch do not know if the author has any experience with the traumas mentioned in the book but think he might considering how in depth he goes in some of them again this is just me speculating and so that helped make this an easy read despite how graphic some descriptions can get graphic as in the author does not try to sugarcoat it when characters are suicidal for example also liked that the author did not try to sell me on some hope and love is all need type of message mind you at the end of the story it does feel like that what we re left with but through heart we see the author being quite real and saying that just because character feels better after their session with heart it does not mean they ll get better all of sudden and that the battle against say depression is an everyday struggle that people unfortunately have to deal with recommend you check doctor for the broken hearted out bought it for like euros and some change but saw that it goes for about euros online that about it from me thanks for reading,"The book follows the week of psychologist Dr. Heart as he sees his patients, each of whom struggle with a different form of trauma. The writing is immersive and character-driven, delving into the depths of each character's struggle with grief, suicide, gender identity, and alcoholism. The author does not shy away from gritty topics, portraying mental illness and trauma in a realistic light. The ending is hopeful, leaving the reader with a sense of authenticity and understanding of the ongoing struggle against mental illness."
was really looking forward to enjoying this and delving into something in the vein of foster wallace overly detailed words unfortunately the whole thing fell flat for me and was let down by kaufman clunky writing lots of interesting ideas here the role of the critic authenticity on visual media isolation in digital age however just didn think kaufman had the writing chops to pull it off many passages of just kaufman describing scenes like he was filming them and failing to give the characters and settings rich detail loved the trump sections and felt this showed kaufman at his strongest pure satire tight scenes and snappy dialogue anyone else read this,"You seem disappointed in Donald Kaufman's writing style in this particular work. While you appreciated the satirical elements and tighter scenes, you found the descriptive passages to be lacking and felt that the characters and settings were not portrayed in enough detail. You were looking for a more in-depth analysis akin to the writing of Foster Wallace, but felt that Kaufman fell short in terms of writing skills.

I could suggest some writing-related resources or books that delve into detailed analysis and critique while also offering rich character development and setting descriptions.

does book with no conflict or problem even exists do not know why it blows my mind that cannot think of any because all stories have to have obstacle to move it forward or for the story to have any point but in the whole history of literature is it possible no one ever wrote just purely positive story where everything goes according to plan think it would probably be boring to read not looking for recommendations love horror it just question love to explore maybe such book was written but was lost in time because no one found it interesting,"It perplexes you that you can't think of a single book that does not contain any conflict or problem as all stories apparently need obstacles to drive them forward; you wonder if such a book has ever been written at all, or if it has simply been lost to time due to its lack of interest.

hello have read the famous metamorphosis before and understood the storyline as it progressed pretty well but recently have started reading more of his works and have stumbled upon description of struggle no matter how many times reread section at points it very difficult for me to follow what happening and the train of thought is it supposed to be this way as the story might be somewhat incoherent or is it just my ridicuously shortened attention span and iq thanks to all the short form video platforms on the internet how should proceed on reading kafka from here as rn am finding the book quite intimidating ps english is technically my second language but my medium of education has always been english and am in university now got on ielts if that helps explain my proficiency so while do admit that my english might not be as skillful as an absolute native but did read metamorphosis and quite few other even older classics so yeah,"You feel that you struggle to follow Kafka's train of thought when reading his works, and you are unsure if it is just you or if it is supposed to be that way.

have hdhp on my insurance card it says blueoptions hsa meet the deductible and oop max limits but use coupon voucher for one of my monthly medications pay insurance reports that pay like or something for some reason and that goes towards my deductible have no idea how this works just know it been that way for years does this disqualify me from an hsa,"You have an HDHP (High Deductible Health Plan) and a voucher that pays for your medication expenses before you meet your deductible. This does not disqualify you from using an HSA (Health Savings Account). An HSA can be used to pay for qualifying medical expenses like deductibles. However, you should verify with your insurance company that they allow HSA contributions while you are receiving deductible vouchers for your medication expenses."
question on roth ira rollover we are rolling over roth ira to new roth ira account this new account only does electronic transactions so had to do full distribution in order to roll it over know you can do full distribution and deposit the amount into new roth ira within days and not be taxed or penalized for an early withdrawal will we receive that shows no taxable income am just confused how the irs will know we are doing day rollover,"You are asking about the process of rolling over your Roth IRA into a new Roth IRA account, and specifically whether you will face any taxes or penalties for an early withdrawal given that your new account only does electronic transactions and you had to take a full distribution in order to roll it over. 

It is important to note that, as long as you deposit the full amount of your distribution into your new Roth IRA within 60 days, you will not be taxed or penalized for an early withdrawal. The IRS will know that you are performing a rollover since you are depositing the funds into a new Roth IRA account. 

It is always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to ensure that you are meeting all the requirements of a tax-free rollover."

Since you've highlighted your goals are focused on maintaining your current lifestyle, family vacations, and saving for retirement, I'd recommend the following:

1. Contribute to your IRA: Max out your IRA contributions to save for retirement. Given your income level, you may want to consider a Roth IRA to provide more tax diversification in retirement.

2. Family Vacation/House Savings: Given your desire to take family vacations and remodel your house, I'd recommend opening a savings account specifically for these goals. Determine an amount you'd like to save annually for these expenses and divide that by 12 to save monthly. 

3. Brokerage Account: Given your timeline and risk tolerance, I'd recommend looking into a portfolio of low-cost index funds for your brokerage account. Given your age and number of years until retirement, I'd recommend being slightly more aggressive than you might otherwise be, but you should still maintain a diversified portfolio. 

4. Car Payment: You've done a great job maintaining no other debt besides your mortgage and car loan."
am years old and make about per year at the moment don think am saving enough here is breakdown of my finances mix of roth and traditional roth ira traditional ira taxable brokerage account savings crypto yes know this is gamble bought house this year and put down as the down payment the total value of the house is and have about left on it with interest rate am hoping to refinance if the rates go down next year spent lot of money the last few years on things such as going to restaurants beer and travel feel like have wasted lot of money am sorry if this sounds ridiculous but is there anything should do differently am maxing out my ira and each year now plan on using the mega back door roth for my this year if can to contribute more,"You are concerned that you are not saving enough and have spent a lot of money on restaurants, beer, and travel. You are looking for suggestions on how to optimize your savings and want to contribute more to your retirement accounts. 

You should consider focusing on paying off your mortgage faster to reduce the amount of interest you pay over time. Additionally, you may want to consider allocating more of your savings towards your retirement accounts, investing in low-cost index funds to maximize your after-tax returns, and creating a budget and sticking to it to help you save more money and spend less on wasteful purchases. 

It would also be helpful to remember that everyone makes mistakes with their money sometimes, and you've identified a desire to improve, which is the first step toward making a change."
hi need bit of advice so figured ask here began with credit score and maintained it up until august so short credit history but have my car two credit cards credit rose ton low to high in when got the cc learned the best way to use them and pay bi monthly statement due date never carry balance after due date never used over on either cc and had just gotten promotion so put birthday trip on one card with the intentions of paying it back within weeks got back from my trip and lost my job but have good savings so planned to rely on that for car and cc have no other bills thankfully an emergency dwindled my savings and wound up months behind on my car and behind on my cc was able to make minimum payments to avoid late reporting was still okay after the first month in the mid but am now in the low overall auto score came back as like but no idea how that one works ve thankfully started new job that pays much more haven gotten my first check yet but was able to use some of savings to pay this month of car still behind and pay cc down to usage on one and on the other plan to pay them both off on due dates end of this month for impact the second card statement date isn until the st so it hasn been reported that ve lowered the usage but know my credit will raise tiny bit once it is concerned because in may started car shopping and it was nice being able to get pretty much anything wanted checked out my dream car week ago and they wanted about down everything checked out in may july didn require anything down just wasn in love with any car saw what would be the best quickest way to raise my credit back up to at least low know the car is going to have to wait mine is good just wanted an upgrade and figure to pay off balances and continue paying on time but wanted to see if there was another way that would benefit more within the next few months only thing ve heard so far is open another card for more reporting revolving accounts but not sure if that smart to do also once do is the day late payment on credit history going to negatively affect me when do finally get it back up that my only negative mark everything else is good but still worries me know this was lot so thanks in advance for any help,"You've done a good job of maintaining a good credit score up until this point and it sounds like you're on the right track to recover from this setback. The most impactful things you can do to raise your credit score are to pay down your credit card balances and make all your payments on time going forward. Unfortunately, late payments do negatively affect your credit score, and they stay on your credit report for 7 years. That said, credit bureaus look at recent behavior more heavily than old behavior, so as long as you maintain good habits from here on out, your score will recover. Opening a new line of credit could potentially help your score, but be cautious not to overextend yourself. If you're able to maintain a low balance on this new card, it will help your score more than if you max it out. Also, be sure to do your research before opening a new line of credit to make sure you're getting the best deal available to you."
hi have read few us healthcare billing adjacent stories here in the past so thought post scenario currently happening to my wife and to see if anyone could be of any assistance so here it goes my wife and had our second child on november over the next couple months we received bills totaling over for the birth and hospital stay one of which was bill for for my wife this did not seem right to us as we had already paid good amount towards our deductible and oop during the year from the months of pregnancy our deductible is oop is for reference during the first few months of our son life there was lot of confusion back and forth with our pediatrician about billing for him between this the total amount still owed from the hospital and collection notice we received in march of for over my wife again reached out to our health care provider and insurance with our concerns we disputed the total amount owed which did include that bill for the exact amount in collections we were told there was problem in our policy and that they never added our child onto our family insurance plan we told them about the collection letter after jumping through all the hoops getting things backdated for our son the health care provider and insurance gave new adjusted total of just under which we paid in full in two payments the last of which was in may of this was the only balance due on our app which covers our entire family through that process we remained in contact with the health care provider pediatrician and insurance asking what we owed and were told this was the total amount we owed on our policy after paying our health care provider billing shows zero balance our app shows zero balance we thought we were doing everything and paid everything in full we never received anything saying otherwise now months later we have received yet another collection notice telling us we owe the same amount the same bill for just over we have contacted both the insurance and our health care provider who claim we do owe this additional amount after all saying it is my wife portion of the hospital bills and that the amount we have paid in full was solely for our child bill we are now trying to figure out what happened we stayed in contact with our health care provider during the confusion paying off our balance that we were given guess now we are just trying to figure out how this additional for my wife went through the cracks through all of this and got sent to collections how months have lapsed with no other indication or communication that this amount was still owed we cannot help but feel there was some negligence during the billing process on behalf of our health care provider or confusion during the calls trying to fix my son issue we called them in march in part because we received the initial collection letter and were under the impression that everything that was figured out on those calls included that issue we now understand that there may be more owed that somehow slipped through the cracks but over just does not sound right again we had been paying towards our deductible and out of pocket all year leading up to the birth we are currently going through everything to figure out exact totals paid we re trying to do more due diligence as we speak but feel like they must have submitted this bill to collections before or during our disputes without telling us anything and we were sort of misled into thinking everything was taken care of it must have disappeared from their billing dept so maybe they did not see it anymore we had mentioned the collection letter back in march when we reached out to them and figured that the new total had reflected everything because my wife remembers them saying it should not be in collections anymore we re basically just looking for any advice or guidance from anyone who may know more about this than us on where to start or how to proceed move forward we have done some preliminary research and are considering filing complaint through the insurance company and or our state ag but just not sure if that right any advice on how to move forward where to start or what to do would be greatly appreciated,"During my wife's pregnancy and the birth of our second child, there was a large amount of confusion regarding the hospital and pediatrician bills. Despite paying our deductible and out-of-pocket amounts for the year, we received a notice in March that there was a bill for my wife for the hospital stay for our son. After disputing the bill and getting our insurance to add our son to our plan, we received an adjusted bill which we promptly paid off in full. However, months later we received another notice for collection for the same bill. Our insurance and healthcare provider are now telling us that we owe the amount- for my wife's portion of the hospital bills. We are considering filing a complaint as we feel there was negligence or confusion, but we're not sure where to start.

recently lost my wedding ring which feel really bad about ve been looking for it for weeks but it seems to just be gone really just like to find it but think it probably truly lost at this point long while back when getting homeowners insurance my wife and put her engagement and wedding rings on the policy as scheduled personal property and then at the last minute we added mine too today called up my homeowners insurance and asked about the process for making claim on the loss was told that this kind of loss is covered and that there no deductible for this type of claim and its insured value is great so then asked whether it would affect my rates going forward was then connected to an underwriter who explained that any claim over will affect my rates but not until because my policy is already written but they said they were not able to share how much it would affect the rates we live in hcol area and our homeowners insurance is currently any ballpark thoughts on how an claim would affect policy assume it would be significant do you think it possible to just file claim to not affect rates and is it just generally dumb to have scheduled personal property insured like this think my replacement wedding band might just be an inexpensive ring since realized do not care about it being fancy metal at this point in my life,"You lost your wedding ring and believe it is lost forever.

long story short had the typical manic episode experience where got into ton of credit card debt essentially signed up for american consumer credit counseling and was able to negotiate payments that are essentially beyond what can afford attempted to secure second job but have had no luck over the past few months and burnt out from my last attempt at working days week when was lucky enough to have two jobs at the beginning of this year and then lost both getting better job is out of the question since my resume is mess and ve primarily worked retail don plan on utilizing credit for any important purchases over the next few years house car definitely out of the question but maybe just build credit after all would be said and done since that what should do the alleviation of stress from having my debt cleared feels like it may be worth it essentially since paying off the debt would exceed years would it be logical to file for bankruptcy in my situation,"You consider filing for bankruptcy as you accumulated significant credit card debt during a manic episode. You've signed up for American consumer credit counseling to negotiate payments, but these are unaffordable. You're considering whether you should focus on rebuilding your credit after paying off your debt or filing for bankruptcy."
hopefully quick one farmers insurance messed up my premiums for whole year sent me final notice bill of paid it had to get in the phone because my balance was showing zero few days later get refund for the exact amount figured they wrote it off or something as it was their fault they messed it up month later two new final notice bills arrive asking for the again at what point does the responsibility for paying balance end just called and they seen no balance until they dug deeper and say oh yeah we refunded that can get you to someone to pay it now,"You've already paid the amount due on your final notice bill and received a refund for the same amount after calling Farmers Insurance to point out they messed up your premium payments for the year. Now you've received two more final notice bills for the same amount and when you called Farmers Insurance about this they claimed there was no balance due until they checked further and admitted to the refund. 

You can ask Farmers Insurance to provide written confirmation that you do not owe any more money on this account and that it has been settled in full, otherwise you may have to continue to dispute the bills receivced. 

This is unfortunately one of those situations where you have to be extremely proactive to ensure that Farmers Insurance does not screw this up further and that your credit score does not take a hit due to their error."

catch me up so it not something weighing on my mind you know hopefully ll be entitled to some tax refunds which will help to offset the costs of paying someone to get this done my taxes will probably involve the following from over employers ve job hopped lot cannot find the ve applied for and received payments from osap few times and ve had tuition related expenses cannot find documentation ve had to pay for some certifications for work several times have these receipts ve had some out of pocket medical expenses that may be eligible to submit have these receipts is it true that there some

info from my bank these are the most complicated claims that might reduce my taxable income if they re valid do not operate business not self employed have not been married have no kids or dependents not senior and do not have disability yet am also interested in applying for the disability tax credit but only after ve caught up on my taxes my psychologist recommended it after reviewing my employment history am undergoing an extensive psychological assessment for severe bipolar disorder and severe adhd both of which have been undiagnosed until recently the testing is going to take place over the course of several months and love to have completed all my taxes by then so that the psychologist can fill out the documentation for mental disability btw the severe adhd and bipolar are why ve been so disorganized unable to complete my education and had frequent job losses so here are my questions what kind of tax professional should be looking for how do verify that they re charging me fair price and they re not some kind of scam artist do not want to hand out my tax info to just any random person who says they do bookkeeping for example do you have any specific suggestions for businesses that help with individual taxes like this in toronto do not mind over paying little bit if know they re legitimate thorough and actually convenient this has been in the back of my mind making me feel guilty for years and being on medication for the first time in my life is giving me some stability and follow through recently qualified for ei for the first time after job loss in my entire life it allowed me to save little bit of money getting properly medicated was my first priority and now it figuring out my taxes someone in similar position to me like almost identical income

anyway any tips on this would be appreciated,I need to file my Canadian taxes but I have not done so in years. I have never done them on my own and need to find a tax professional to help me catch up. I am entitled to refunds and credits but I am worried about the cost of hiring someone and ensuring they are legitimate. I am also interested in applying for the disability tax credit.
hi have an old brokerage account an early robo investing firm that would like to close in order to consolidate simplify and reduce some fees the initial contribution was and it is around right now this firm charges for acat and non acat transfer out fidelity is to be receiving the assets but doubt they would reimburse me for such low transfer amount their webpage indicates you may be eligible to have another firm account transfer fee reimbursed if the transferred account balance was more than you may also be eligible for reimbursement if you have over in personal investment assets at fidelity so could be eligible for the latter criteria do have sufficient rollover capital losses at this time to cover everything if were to just liquidate it all the assets are mix of vti vea vwo vnq lqd vgit tip sjnk vcsh ultimately think would get rid of the bonds about because have bonds elsewhere in tax sheltered accounts most at least of the assets will be subject to long term capital gains what do you think is the best option liquidate everything to cash or transfer to fidelity with possible transfer fee that is not reimbursed thanks,"You have an old brokerage account and want to close it to consolidate your assets and reduce fees. The account has a balance of $1200 and is currently with an early robo-investing firm. The firm charges a fee to transfer assets ($125 for a non-ACAT transfer). You plan to transfer the assets to Fidelity, but Fidelity will not reimburse the transfer fee. The account holds a mix of stocks and bonds. What do you think is the best option: liquidating the account to cash or transferring the assets to Fidelity with the possible transfer fee? 

Liquidate the account to cash and pay the capital gains tax, or transfer the assets to Fidelity and pay the transfer fee ($125). 

Fidelity may reimburse the transfer fee if you have over $150,000 in personal investment assets at Fidelity, or if the transferred account balance was more than $75,000. 

You could also consider selling the bond funds and transferring the stock funds, to reduce the capital gains liability. 

Let me know if you have any other questions or need any further assistance!"

hi all my car is in my name and step moms name my dad and her filed for bankruptcy years ago and my car was included think but not sure how it all works my question is what would need to get title loan today know they are terrible but am having an emergency and need the funds immediately thank you,"You would need to contact the company that you are considering obtaining a title loan from and ask them what their requirements are. In general, you will need to have ownership of the car outright, meaning there are no other liens or holders on the vehicle. You will also need to have proof of income and residency in order to obtain a title loan. 

It is important to be aware that title loans are considered to be predatory lending, as they often come with extremely high-interest rates and fees, and can lead to further financial difficulties if not repaid quickly. It may be worth exploring other options, such as personal loans or borrowing from friends or family, if possible."

need some advice here years old and want to make sure saving properly for retirement would say am slightly risk averse and like the idea of having nest egg when older that is not necessarily tied to the stock market for reference am currently maxing out my hold cds bonds regularly invest in brokerage account and have an emergency fund sitting in hysa also have few investments in reits and fine arts but these do not account for much ve spoken with financial advisor not fiduciary who has urged me to look into permanent life insurance plan as an addition to my portfolio the reasons he gave which mostly agree with were it matches my desire for low risk investment to grow my money it would provide non market correlated fund to fall back on in retirement when the stock market tanks it is potentially more flexible liquid than other investments in that you can borrow against it to buy or invest elsewhere it has tax advantages it has long term care rider which do have interest in if not now maybe later in life the thing is not interested in the death benefit do not plan on having children also concerned about additional fees and being able to draw down the balance in retirement other investment options provide much higher return but are often linked to the market the other con see is that once you agree to this policy you are locked in otherwise you have to surrender the policy and most likely take loss the most important thing to me is making sure have enough money to last for retirement and maybe retiring slightly early if it makes sense the company is northwestern mutual which does have very good reputation history of paying out dividends and their interest rate has never fallen below over the last years is it worth it to go with this policy ve heard lot of negatives about perm life but it seems like these were cases where people did not necessarily have the money for the policy in the first place will not have trouble making these payments but is this the best use for my money are other alternatives better cds and hysa are great but know these rates will not last forever real estate seems like good option but do not have the time for it other than something like an reit municipal bonds are something want to look into as well as they seem to be lower risk with decent returns and tax advantages but my advisor said the returns on these will not match what could see with perm life anybody out there with this type of policy do you regret it and wish you did something differently is my financial advisor just trying to sell me product or is this actually good recommendation for what want want to make sure do not regret anything down the line thanks in advance for your help,"You seem to be on the right track for retirement savings given your age and risk aversion, but a financial advisor recommended you look into permanent life insurance.

hello like always love to learn from this subreddit thanks to this subreddit started investing and using ccs correctly so this year only generated money from crypto trading using webull didt work or had any other source of income before dealing with an accountant want to be able to calculate the estimated tax need to pay from short term gains trades and long term gains trades made did my research but still need to confirm what am doing so did an excel document where separated the long term gains trades from the short ones summed only the gains up not the base investment now how do calculate the tax for long and short term capital gains and add them up together know tax percent is based on total gains but lets assume did less than summing up short and long term gains this year,"You need to calculate your short-term and long-term capital gains tax based on your total earnings, not just the sum of your gains. 
To calculate your taxes accurately, you need to:
1. Determine your cost basis: this is the amount you spent to buy your crypto
2. Determine the fair market value of your crypto when you sold it
3. Short-term gains are taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term gains are taxed at capital gains rates
4. Use a tax calculator or consult a tax professional to determine your exact liability

It is advisable to double-check with a tax professional specializing in crypto to make sure your calculations are correct."

so currently have robinhood account with of stock mostly split between stocks is there way for me to convert this or transfer this to another brokerage as roth ira think like to open fidelity account and create roth through them if so is there tax implications as both roth and the traditional stock account are post tax contributions thanks for any advice ve tried looking this up and not sure understanding could be considered back door roth possibly also have another roth currently from few years ago with broker don enjoy and has around dollars in there,"You can transfer your Robinhood stocks to another brokerage firm, but you will need to open a Roth IRA account at the new brokerage in order to do so. Because you already paid taxes on the money in your traditional brokerage account, you can transfer the value of the stocks into a Roth IRA account without any tax implications. As for your existing Roth IRA with another broker, you can also transfer that account to Fidelity. Sometimes the easiest way to do this is to open the Roth IRA account at Fidelity and then initiate a transfer of the account from your existing broker to Fidelity. They will handle the details. 

It's important to note that any transfers between retirement accounts should be done carefully to avoid any tax implications or penalties. It might be wise to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to determine the best way to transfer your accounts."

You intend to save less in order to live more in the moment, while still saving enough to upgrade your house in the near future. 

It is difficult for me to say precisely whether this is a good idea as it depends on your specific circumstances and preferences. Typically, it is recommended to save enough to cover an emergency expense, and to invest in your retirement portfolio commensurate with your goals and desired lifestyle. 

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to determine a savings and investment plan that aligns with your goals and ensures you have adequate funds to cover both your near-term and long-term expenses.

so had opened solo and roth ira do not have any employee and just work for myself max contribution was told is between the two accounts if make the max contribution will all that be deductible by end of year tax so say my net income for the year is will get the standard deductible of which brings it down to then the full from contribution which brings it down to around as my total net income for the year and then taxes will be determined by percentage for federal and state based on that,"You are self-employed and want to know if your maximum contribution to a Solo 401k and a Roth IRA will be tax deductible. For this question, we would need to know the exact maximum contribution limits for each plan type which change annually. For the tax deduction, this depends on your income and self-employment taxes. You can deduct your retirement contributions on your tax return to lower your taxable income, which will then determine your federal and state taxes. 

To receive a more detailed answer, it would help to know your state of residence, your age, and the specific maximum contribution limits for the year you're planning to contribute.

emergency hysa employer match roth ira hsa etc while individual circumstances will vary there is general order of operations suggested based on things like tax advantages employer contributions and so on if an employer offers discount on espp bought pre tax where would you say that falls in terms of prioritizing where your money goes after match but before roth ira since it could be used to fund roth ira faster cheaper,"You should prioritize using any employer matching funds offered on your retirement savings accounts, like a 401k, before any other savings. After matching retirement savings, funding a pre-tax HSA, 401k, or ESPP through your employer is generally the next best option due to the tax advantages. Once you've maxed out your employer contributions to these accounts, you should consider using an individual Roth IRA contribution.

hey guys need your advice have pretty complex story everything started in october when started looking for remote internships in foreign countries so found company where you pay and they guarantee you an internship paid an upfront cost of so they can start looking for offers one day receive an offer from company they want to offer me an internship so they tell me to end my contract with company because they can hire me as an intern directly accept it since it means don have to pay the rest of to company so now company offers me the months contract in this contract they even make up fiscal code for me telling me the fiscal code can be calculated manually obviously don have that fiscal code because don reside in their country the internship ends after months and they want to offer me full time contract now but since they are based in different country than me they ask me to open my own business entity and then sign service contract with them so in march go and open one person business entity it called authorised physical person in my country then sign service contract with them between their company and my business entity and start billing them every month the same amount monthly time goes and now we are in december taxes will drastically increase in for my business entity so take the following decision go and form another business entity this time an official llc because llc taxes will be smaller in so can sign new contract between their company and my llc important to mention have never received equipment from them don have work schedule or anything like that am mainly given weekly tasks and at the end of the week have to present them they are however the only client of my business entity what do you think about this whole situation do you think can be misclassified as an employee or not have broken any other laws like tax evasion am really scared because of all that is happening don want to get into any trouble,"You paid an internship placement agency to find you an internship abroad. You ended your contract with them after you received an offer directly from the internship company who were offering to hire you. They have asked you to set up your own business and sign a services contract with them. You have since set up a second business in order to reduce taxes. 

It is difficult to say whether you have been misclassified as an employee or not, however, it is unusual for an internship to require you to set up your own business entity. It is also unusual that you are their only client and you aren't provided with equipment, a work schedule, or supervision. This could indicate that you are in fact an employee and not a contracted freelancer. 

Regarding tax evasion, while setting up a business entity to reduce taxes is not in itself illegal, doing so to deliberately mislead your employer into thinking they are contracting with a company when you are in fact an employee could potentially be illegal. 

You should consult a legal professional specializing in labor law and taxation to review your specific situation and protect your rights."

start new job in january and have big likely expensive doctors appointments in february are you allowed to just put one time lump sum into one of these cards or does it have to be added monthly the internet isn crazy helpful but has me thinking the answer is no,"You can pay a lump sum to your healthcare flexible spending account (FSA) if you want to, as long as it's within the year. You can also add money to it monthly. It's a good idea to add enough to cover your expenses, but you may also want to consider adding a little extra to cover any additional expenses or surprise medical needs. 

It's important to note that the IRS regulates FSA accounts, and you may want to consult their website for any updates or changes to the rules regarding these accounts. 

It's also important to remember that FSAs are use-it-or-lose-it accounts. You may want to estimate your expenses carefully to ensure you don't lose any contributions you make to your account."

Based on the information you provided, it sounds like you are asking about whether you should claim your business income or deductions on your taxes in a given year. The ""smartest"" route will depend on your specific circumstances and goals, and may change from year to year. It also depends on whether you are filing as a sole proprietor or LLC and the type of deductions you have. 

Generally, business expenses and deductions are used to reduce your business income when calculating your tax liability. It is possible that claiming all of your business deductions in a year when you have minimal income could result in a net loss for your business. This could potentially have tax benefits carryover to future years. 

However, this is a general explanation and may not cover all the specifics of your situation. It's always best to consult a professional for personalized advice."

background our house has gone up considerably in value the past year so we will be looking to move in maybe years time to bigger house with slightly bigger mortgage ve always wanted to cut some chunks into our current mortgage by paying off year but is there any financial benefit in this if we re going to take new mortgage that will presumably be bit more expensive month to month in future the profits from this house will go to the deposit for the new house down therefore slightly offset the more expensive mortgage payment,"I would like to know if it is worth paying off my current mortgage in full before moving to a new house in a few years, given that the house's value has increased considerably. We plan to use the profits from this house as a deposit for the new house, which will have a bigger mortgage. 

Would paying off my current mortgage result in more savings than putting additional payments towards the new mortgage?

applied just to see if would qualify for another home did now really contemplating buying nd home and leasing it out currently make pay mortage on my first home have my car payment this second home would be cheap house in the midwest what do you think should go for it would use it as second form of income thinking doing section with it do not have really any savings and if lost my job tomorrow be pretty much in the hole but also kinda wanting to take the jump thoughts,"You are contemplating buying a cheap midwest house and leasing it out as a second form of income. However, you are already making mortgage payments on your first home and have car payments to worry about. You have no savings and if you lose your job tomorrow, you would be in a tight spot. 

I think you should reconsider taking on more debt as it may not be the best choice for your current situation. Buying a house is a major financial decision and there are many factors to consider. It would be wise to consult a financial advisor or planner to help you assess your budget and determine if this is a wise decision for you. 

Have you considered renting out a room in your current home to generate additional income instead of taking on another property? This could help increase your savings and provide some financial security without adding to your debt.

hi everyone about to make move to hcol city and was wondering other people opinions on how much should pay for rent did the math and figured could afford month with student loans saving etc but would love to hear other opinions gross monthly income before taxes or year owe about in student loans and around in credit cards the latter ll be paying off in my first month of working other than general expenses like the loans utilities food my phone bill month and gym membership don have any other expenses thanks in advance,"Moving to a high cost of living city, wondering how much is too much to spend on rent given their gross monthly income, student loan debt, and other expenses. 

They have around $2,000 in student loans and $1,000 in credit card debt, and expect $4,000 per month in take-home pay after taxes. They have no other debts. 

They are wondering if they can afford to spend around $2,000 per month on rent. 

This will depend on the exact city they are moving to, as cost of living varies widely. 

Would they be living alone, or with roommates? Does the rental include utilities? Does the cost include parking, or will that be an additional expense? 

These factors will need to be considered to determine if this is a realistic monthly rental expense."

kind of long story but the bare bones is that my in laws had somewhere around in all kinds of different cc debt some of it was with regular credit cards and some of it was with various different store credit cards like best buy american eagle etc they ended up getting quasi deported that the long story part and were out of the country for about years while they were gone all kinds of debt collectors were showing up to their house trying to collect but they were not there and eventually the debt collectors quit showing up well they came back couple years ago and they just recently passed years since they started missing their payments on all of this different debt they just saw that their credit scores shot up and there are no more delinquencies or anything like that pending was already vaguely aware of bad credit reports falling off of the reports after years but the debt does not just disappear does it they re convinced that they re completely absolved of any debt now but cannot imagine that that ll be the case and afraid the companies have probably just sold the debt and they can be expecting some more debt collectors at some point in the future does anybody have any insight on this can debt really just disappear or are they about to get boned,"Your in-laws have been gone for years and during that time debt collectors stopped coming around. They are now back and wondering if the debt has disappeared along with the debt collectors. 

Are they still responsible for the debt even though the collectors are no longer pursuing them?"

To provide a more detailed and personalized answer, could you please provide more information about your current salary, other sources of income, and any other debts or financial obligations you may have? 

Based on the information you provided, it seems like you are doing a good job of saving for your retirement, but there are a few things you can consider to potentially increase your savings and reach your goals faster. 

First, pay off your car loan as soon as possible to free up that monthly payment for other purposes. By paying extra each month, you can reduce the term of your loan and save on interest charges. 

Second, consider if there are any other areas where you can cut back on your expenses, such as entertainment, dining out, or subscription services you may not use regularly."

plan on doing some tax loss harvesting the question have is have some individual stocks that have not performed very well this year however do think they have future upside years from now so want to sell some of the positions from my brokerage for loss so last month purchased shares in another account in preparation to sell these do have to wait days from the exercised date date initiated the sale or the settled date example purchased the stock in the other account at and the settlement date is sure its ok to sale may take more than days to settle just wanted to see what everyone else has experienced,"You can recognize a loss on a security if you sold it for a lower price than you paid for it and if you held the security for more than one year. 

To avoid the wash sale rule, you cannot repurchase the security for more than 30 days before or after the sale. It is okay to sell the stock you purchased in another account before the settlement date. 

Given your belief in the stock's future upside, you might want to consider deferring the sale until after 31 days to avoid the wash sale rule and prevent missing out on potential gains."

We both have significant student loan debt but high incomes with big bonuses expected next year. We'd like to buy a house soon, and have saved up a decent amount, but I'm worried about our debt.

It is reasonable to consider buying a house soon, despite your outstanding student loan debt. However, it is important to consider your savings, income, and debt stability when deciding on such a large purchase. It is beneficial to weigh the pros and cons of your financial situation and long-term goals, such as starting a family. It may be wise to seek the advice of a financial advisor or planner to help you make an informed decision."

You are interested in learning about how to allocate funds towards this new savings goal without forgoning other financial goals. 

I would be happy to help you with your question about opening a savings account for your child. There are several factors to consider and savings strategies that you can use to help you reach your goal. 

First, it's great that you are thinking about saving for your child's future. Savings accounts can be a great way to put money aside for your child's education or other future expenses. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Determine your goal: Think about what you want to save for specifically. Is it for your child's education? A down payment on a house? Retirement for yourself? Having a clear goal will help you determine how much you need to save and for how long.

2. Calculate your savings target: Once you have a goal in mind, you can calculate how much you will need to save each month to reach that goal by a certain date. Online calculators can help you determine the sum you need to save overall and the monthly contributions needed to reach that target."

fed has announced their perhaps tentative plan to cut rate times in coming year people are saying now is the time to lock in the rates notes or bonds are paying little less than cds or gsa bonds but they are not callable and state local tax free and you can sell them in ndary market after only days if rates get cut then their price should go up little thinking locking into bonds or notes should be better than locking into cds or gsa bonds or something else anyone can share their financial thought,"Many people think that now is the time to lock in rates before the federal reserve cuts rates in the coming year. Bonds and notes have comparatively lower returns than CDs or GSA bonds, but they are not callable, tax free, and can be sold after only a few days in the secondary market. If rates decrease, the price of these bonds and notes will increase, making them a better investment than CDs or GSA bonds."
have approximately to pay in capital gains tax come next year single filing no dependents am able to make charitable donations to negate that cg tax would rather give money to charity support than to the government if it reasonable for me to accomplish have not kept sales tax records made any car purchases etc have not made over in charitable donations throughout the year if understand correctly my best option is to take the standard deduction since can only take the standard deduction or itemize deductions if itemized deductions,"You want to know if you should itemize your deductions or take the standard deduction on your tax return. Since you haven't kept records of your expenses and deductions, you likely cannot itemize. This means taking the standard deduction is your best option.

Since your current employer does not offer an HSA account, you have chosen to open up a Fidelity account, owing to its reputation. 

Since you are already investing in Vanguard mutual funds, specifically Vgstx and vti, you have three options:

1. You may choose to buy different Vanguard funds to diversify your portfolio. 2. You can invest in Fidelity funds, as this will diversify your portfolio and take advantage of funds that Fidelity offers. Perhaps a financial advisor can help you analyze the funds FSKAX specifically. 
3. You can also consider other investment options that align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. 

As you are new to managing your investments, it may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor to determine the best approach based on your personal financial situation."

You are wondering about the importance of Morningstar ratings and whether there are better funds than GWPFX. 

It is important to note that diversification across different asset classes is a generally accepted method of managing investment risk and that past performance does not indicate future results.

option house deposit years mortage will pay interest in life time of the loan option house deposit years mortage will pay interest in life time of the loan so even if am paying more upfront will gain only interest saved in long term am planning on option and dump the remaining into taxable brokerage account let me know if am making wrong choice or not sorry for the typo,"You are considering buying a house and taking out a mortgage loan. You are wondering if paying a larger amount upfront will save you money in interest payments over the lifetime of the loan. You plan to invest any amount you save from interest in a taxable brokerage account. 

I cannot offer financial advice but may generate a summary of the considerations to help you make this decision. One important factor to consider is that by paying a larger amount upfront, you will be reducing the principal amount of your loan, which will result in lower interest payments over the lifetime of the loan. This can save you money in the long term and help you pay off your mortgage faster.

Another factor to consider is that by investing any amount you save from interest in a taxable brokerage account, you may be able to generate additional income or growth on your investment. However, there are no guarantees of returns on investments, and the brokerage market is volatile and carries inherent risks. It's important to carefully consider your risk tolerance and financial goals before making any investment decisions.

It would help if you also thought about the opportunity cost of investing the extra payment in a brokerage account. While you may earn returns on your investment, you also risk losing money."

Index funds are a type of investment fund that track the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P 500. Paying off debt is usually recommended over investing in index funds when the interest rate on the debt is higher than the expected rate of return on the investments.

so opened one couple months ago and see that they are projecting rates to drop over the next year or so will always get this rate on that savings account or will that move down with rates if it permanent then why wouldn everyone open one just to park their emergency savings forever edit that should say hysa idk why autocorrect hates me,"You won't necessarily get a low interest rate forever just because you open a savings account with one now.

am looking into building an addition my home and would rather not get loan from the bank one ave to get some funds for the project might be from my roth ira am curious on how the rules work with pulling money out of them in regards to the penalties here is the scenario with all the relative facts can think of am have roth ira that started years ago with funds contributed from my bank account years ago rolled over funds from tradition ira conversion might be the right name am still adding funds to the roth from conversions from traditional ira and contributions from my bank account when can access my funds in the roth ira without penalty,"You generally need to wait at least five years after contributing to a Roth IRA to withdraw your funds without penalty. Because you are continuing to contribute to your Roth IRA, you will need to consider the rules for accessing funds based on the type of contribution made to the account. Speak with a financial advisor about your specific situation to come up with a plan to access your funds. 

It would be best if you avoided pulling from your retirement savings to fund a home addition unless you've exhausted other options. Withdrawing funds from your Roth IRA could result in taxes and penalties if you're not careful, and you'll miss out on the benefits of compounding interest that would have grown your retirement savings over time. If you're looking to fund your home addition project consider looking at other funding sources such as a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a personal loan. These types of loans may have more favorable terms and rates compared to withdrawing from your retirement savings. 

It's also important to note that withdrawing funds from your retirement account could impact your retirement plans and hinder your progress towards your financial goals."

Speak to a financial advisor to see if this is a good option for you. Contributing to retirement accounts has penalties for early withdrawals and penalties if you do not wait until you are 59 and a half years old to withdraw. 
Make sure you consider these factors when choosing how to offset your taxes."

had to scramble to come up with the cash to buy house with assumable loan as result have relatively large amount of credit card debt at fixed rate thanks to scra also have loan at interest but the interest goes to me having trouble figuring out which to focus on paying off first and why for the loan how should factor in the interest going back to me vs the cost of not having my money invested,"You have to decide whether to pay off your credit card debt or your loan with interest going to you. Consider the interest rate on each obligation and how quickly you can pay it off to determine which to focus on first. Also, consider the opportunity cost of paying off the loan versus investing the money. 

Are you interested in a more detailed analysis of your finances to determine which to pay off first?"
it primarily insurance not an investment you have to consider the chance of dying in year one where your return would be massive something like this has to be factored in when calculating average returns it tax advantaged without limit you cannot just compare average stock market returns those get taxed life insurance gains are not taxed you have to consider this when calculating returns and unlike an ira you can dump as much money as you want at life insurance it liquid unlike retirement accounts you can access your cash value at any time either by cashing out or by more strategically taking out loan which requires no credit check and has no minimum payments guaranteed returns there place for fixed income in portfolio we do not tell anyone to never invest in bonds they have their place stock markets often go decade with negative returns higher returns come with higher risk you can borrow against the money you pay in premiums relatively quickly if the policy is structured properly traditional policies agree take too long to get your money back in cash value if you get pua and term rider and put less money towards the premium you can break even in cash value at year or the death benefit is of course always positive in all think you should look more closely at whole life insurance it not simply horrid investment like dave ramsey says his understanding of whole life insurance is really ignorant overall and you cannot expect an average of returns year after year from the stock market like dave ramsey says ps not life insurance agent and have nothing to sell you,#NAME?
my fianc and just bought house closed and funded last week we took the down payment out of my account and he is going to pay me back with cashier check that he already took out of his account know that depositing cash will make the bank report the transaction to the irs totally fine with that but wondering if there anything need to do to let them know that this is just him paying me back for part of home down payment and not income self employed so deposit checks from clients all the time but not cash being audited would just be pain because am self employed so my taxes are much more complex anything in particular should know am at higher risk of being audited because of this,"You and your fiancé took a down payment for your house out of your accounts and you're worried about the IRS auditing you after you deposit his cash payment for reimbursement. You're self-employed which makes your taxes more complex and you want to know if you're at higher risk of being audited. 

It's important to know that the IRS reports cash deposits of more than $10,000 as required by the Bank Secrecy Act. Depositing multiple cash payments less than $10,000 to avoid reporting requirements is illegal. 

It would be best to speak to a tax professional about your specific situation to help you determine the best way to document this transaction and to understand whether you need to amend your tax returns. It's also important to consult a legal professional to understand the legal implications of your arrangement with your fiancé regarding the property ownership and payments made. 

It's important to note that the IRS audits individuals based on a variety of factors and depositing a large cash sum is just one of many factors that could increase your chances of an audit."
hi year old recent graduate here with very little personal finance knowledge and very much living paycheck to paycheck looking for the best next steps currently making year taking home per month living at home with my parents do not currently contribute in rent plan is to work this job for another year have in my savings account have in cc debt not accruing interest paying off month have in student loans subsidized and subsidized repayment begins in february at month but am considering pursuing something more aggressive do not have any investment accounts planning on opening asap not sure what the best thing to prioritize is outside of the would love any insight as to how much should prioritize in terms of saving investing and paying off student loans,"You are living paycheck-to-paycheck and have debt. You don't contribute to rent or utilities at your parents' home. You have savings, but also have credit card debt and student loans. You are considering changing your repayment plan for your student loans. 

What you should do:
1. Calculate your budget: Build an accurate picture of your monthly expenses and prioritize essential spending.
2. Increase income: Look for ways to increase your income, such as freelancing or taking on a part-time job.
3. Pay off credit card debt: With your current income, focus on paying off your credit card debt to save on interest payments.
4. Create an emergency fund: Once your credit card debt is paid off, prioritize building an emergency fund equal to six months' worth of expenses.
5. Invest: Consider investing in a retirement account and, once you've reached your emergency fund goal, look into investing in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds to increase your long-term wealth.
6. Review student loan options: Consider your repayment plan and whether you can afford to make larger payments or pay off the loans more quickly.

Remember, managing your finances is a gradual process."
so on paper it seems ll have disposable income probably not in reality with unexpected purchases this year took out mortgage thats at at yr also just took out in student loans to finish school and settle divorce stuff at now teacher so that loan might be forgiven in ten years but not really sure how it works but ve been public school employee for years now and think they drop loans after ten anyway this makes me think should put my disposable income into the house despite it being lower interest rate compared to the school loans what should spend this on certainly not on myself lol,"You have many significant upcoming expenses, such as mortgage payments, student loans, and divorce settlement. Since the student loans have a lower interest rate, it is better to pay them off faster to avoid accumulating more interest. However, you cannot decide between paying off your student loans or putting extra money into your house payments. 

Are there any other aspects of your finances that you would like to discuss or receive more information on?"

They also offer features like budget planning, expense categorization, and spending alerts to help you stay on top of your finances."

let say in you had in qualified education expenses you also received student loan all of which went towards those expenses my question is in that scenario how much can you withdraw from your to pay for your expenses can you withdraw full even though you paid for of the expenses with money from loan can you withdraw only the expenses minus the loan or could you even withdraw the full expenses plus to pay off loan principle via the student loan lifetime limit the irs website mentions that when withdrawing from your qualified education expenses should be considered reduced by any tax free funds you received to offset your qualified education expenses but it does not mention loans and obviously loan is not tax free because loan is not taxable in the first place thank you,"You may withdraw from your 529 plan the full amount of qualified education expenses, even if some of those expenses were paid using student loans. You might choose to only withdraw the amount necessary to pay the expenses minus the amount of the loan, to avoid paying interest on the loan. Any amount you withdraw from the 529 plan that is used to pay qualified education expenses is not taxable, but loans are not taxable so this rule does not apply to them."

recently quit my job and got sick shortly after my employer ended coverage dec opened ticket about not being able to see options dec dec called the hotline and asked about the ticket trying to get an appointment the system had not updated when called and had not received letter about cobra costs over the phone the quote was per month the actual total is per pay period this is way too much need to cancel coverage and refute this charge being times more than expected how do refute the charge,"You should speak to your former employer about the error in the quoted cost of your COBRA coverage. Be sure to document all of your communications with your former employer and COBRA provider to make sure that you have a record of your efforts to resolve the issue. If necessary, you can also get in touch with the Department of Labor to file a complaint and seek further assistance. 

It's important to note that COBRA coverage can be expensive because it allows you to maintain your previous health coverage temporarily after leaving your job. As such, the cost of the plan may reflect the total cost of the coverage, including any administrative fees. It's also possible that there was a misunderstanding about the quoted cost of the coverage. 

It's best to explore other health insurance options to find more affordable coverage that meets your needs. Ensure you're aware of the open enrollment period for other plans, or you may qualify for a special enrollment period due to a life event such as job loss."

hi have done some slightly wacky things with my ira contributions this year and am little confused so couple years ago opened traditional ira with rowe price brokerage invested into that account this year it already had about then decided wanted to use vanguard halfway through this year brokerage opened another traditional ira contributed to the vanguard one then did an asset transfer from brokerage ira to brokerage ira then decided actually want to contribute to roth ira this year so opened vanguard roth ira recharacterized my earlier vanguard ira contribution to be roth contribution and through the rest of the year have contributed to the roth the assets transferred from rowe price and contributed with rowe price are still in the traditional account but think was not very careful about any of this math and may have overcontributed this year is there way for me to fix this my vanguard accounts both the traditional and roth say that still have and respectively that can contribute before max out which is really confusing and think is just not right why do they have different amounts before max out is not the max contribution shared between the iras was the asset transfer contribution ahhhh,"You might have made a mistake with your IRA contributions this year and exceeded the limit. An asset transfer between traditional IRAs does not affect your contribution limit. You need to contact a financial advisor and calculate how much you have contributed to both IRAs this year and correct your mistakes going forward, if necessary, by withdrawing excess contributions.

am on dmp with stepchange since december on track to being debt free by march thank you stepchange one thing struggle to understand however is the rules around when an account goes into default specifically two of my creditors amex and sainsburys have my account status reported as in arrears and have marked me with missed payments for almost year in sainsburys case got default notice in october but as of december ve been advise that the amount paying through stepchange is now higher than the amount that would make the account go into default and that it will not be passed to debt collection agency at this stage however because in arrears and they only record arranged payments for short term period they are marking my credit file as missed payment every month for amex the debt has been passed to nco but the account status is in arrears missed payments and there is no notice of the account being defaulted will try speaking with amex this week for clarity in the meantime what would appreciate guidance clarity on is whether it is possible or even recommended that ask amex and sainsburys to default my accounts and backdate it to when the account went into arrears my concern is that if the accounts do not go into default and only get updated as settled in march when due to clear of all my debts that it means the year clock for clearing off my file only starts then as opposed to starting from the date the account defaulted if that makes sense maybe misunderstanding something but it feels like not being defaulted will do more harm to my credit file in the longer term because of the prolonged missed payment markers many thanks for any guidance,"You've been in arrears and have missed payments on your Amex and Sainsbury's accounts for almost a year. Although your debt payment through Stepchange is now higher than the amount required to prevent default, the accounts remain in arrears and are marked negatively on your credit file. You want to know if you can ask Amex and Sainsbury's to backdate your account default to when the account went into arrears. 

Backdating a default can be detrimental to your credit file, but you can contact Amex and Sainsbury's to inquire about updating your account status. It would be best if you considered conversing with a financial advisor or debt counselor to assess your account status and develop a plan to improve your credit score."

Note that it's generally not a great idea to choose investments based on their expense ratio alone, as performance and other factors are also very important. That being said, Vanguard offers a wide range of funds and index funds with generally very low expense ratios, and it may be helpful to research specific funds that align with your investment goals. You might also consider consulting with a financial advisor to determine what investments are best for your specific needs.

just graduated few years ago and just started what hope will be my forever job am not literate in investing saving at all completely on me and how grew up have obviously heard of ks before but don actually know what it does can someone in the simplest terms possible explain to me what roth ira actually is want to make the right financial choice for my future but don have any prior information,"A Roth IRA is a type of investment account that allows you to save for retirement after taxes have been taken out. This is different from other retirement accounts, such as a traditional IRA, where you get tax breaks upfront but have to pay taxes on your withdrawals in retirement. With a Roth IRA, you pay taxes on your contributions now, but your investments grow tax-free and you won't have to pay taxes on your withdrawals in retirement. This makes a Roth IRA particularly attractive if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket later in life."
hello as many of you know the old age advise of buying used car to not take the initial depreciation hit has not been entirely possible the past couple years since used cars have been going for premium in the market for fulfilling my transportation needs and wondering if thinking about these opportunity costs around financing and paying cash the correct way in various scenarios let say we are comparing these two scenarios lightly used car versus brand new one im going to use some arbitrary numbers since the exact numbers dont matter much here they are just variables assumptions hysa safe investment return know this will fluctuate with fed rate but lets assume it stays at for this lol new car loan promo apr new car loan down payment new car amount otd new car monthly payment ignoring new car depreciation because would keep the car for years like my last one new car otd apr loan monthly payment with the new car we can calculate how much we pay in interest to get true cost while also taking into account the cash we got to keep thus allowing us to earn interest investing it interest earned starting with and withdrawing the monthly payment every month and earning payed on loan over months with down earned interest paid interest earned by financing that can be subtracted from the total car price otd total cost for the new financed car used car years old expected time to keep the car yrs otd paid in cash because used car loans have aprs that are higher than safe investment like hysa currently now this is what not sure about should also add to the total cost of paying cash for the used car the opportunity cost of investing the cash or is that double dipping because already not financing for some reason cannot get it straight in my mind assuming it not double dipping the opportunity cost of not having access to the to invest earning in hysa for months is better way to calculate it to consider the fact that when paying for the car in cash would have no monthly payment freeing up that cash to invest so if took what would have been my monthly payment and invested it gaining interest on the amount increasing by the would be monthly payment each month is what not sure about what is the actual total cost of buying this used car in cash taking into account the opportunity cost of being able to invest the money at versus financing new feel like overcomplicating it but looking for some input to help me get this straight know this is long so thanks for taking the time to read it,"Used car prices have been high for the last few years, so it may seem like there is no advantage to buying a used car to avoid depreciation. When considering whether to pay in cash or finance, there are opportunity costs either way. Financing a car means paying interest, but you could invest the cash you save from not making monthly payments.

swe making around my rent is auto loan insurance got into an accident earlier this year other expensive are prob right now maxing my employer contribution to my and maxing my hsa have around in the bank keep seeing paying off high interest debt close to ira hsa in the priority lists in the process of making budget and assume interest rate is high enough to be paid asap but how should factor in contributing to my hsa ira have around year of experience as swe and hoping to job hop somewhat soon should also factor in potential salary increase within the next year if so how does that play into this,"You've got a few different finances to consider here, so let's break them down:

1. Auto loan: It's generally a good idea to pay off high-interest debt like an auto loan as soon as possible to avoid accumulating more interest. Depending on the interest rate you're paying, this might be one of your top financial priorities.

2. Retirement accounts: Contributing to your retirement through an IRA or 401k is a great way to set yourself up for the future, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. The sooner you start contributing, the longer your money has to grow. That said, if you've got high-interest debt like credit cards, it's generally recommended to prioritize paying those off first. Otherwise, you're losing money to interest payments rather than earning through investments. Ultimately, how you prioritize retirement contributions will depend on your personal financial goals and circumstances. If you expect a salary increase in the next year, you could potentially increase your contributions incrementally.

3. HSAs: A Health Savings Account (HSA) can be a great way to save for current and future healthcare expenses, especially if you have a high-deductible health plan."
my father in law is getting older and recently had scare where phone scammer pretending to be calling from his bank managed to convince him to give up bank account and social security numbers he realized what was happening in time and managed to block the guy from doing anything but it rattled him and he asked my wife and and my brother in law to help him manage his money and basically keep the bulk of it in pot that he would not have access to in similar situation one way we were thinking about approaching this would be for the bulk of his money to be in an account that our generation has access to and then we transfer him an allowance once month or so for his spending money it long dumb story but he does not actually have any proper retirement accounts and instead just has large sum sitting in bank account that he lives off of in addition to his social security our thought is that our generation would control this big account we would want to have structure around this account where the account is in his name and not ours but the bank recognizes that our generation has the right to access it we want because it likely he going to be applying for potentially subsidized senior apartments in the near future and do not want to make it seem like he trying to hide assets and we do not want it to look like that account contains our assets for our own financial purposes we want because we want to make sure we can do banking stuff if things get to the point where we re interacting with person rather than just logging into the account our thought is that we would not formally restrict him from accessing this account but instead just would not give him the password login information would there be way to set this up with the bank itself or would we first need to get some kind of formal power of attorney document or is the power of attorney something the bank could set up for us and if so would that only apply in narrow scope to the bank account or would it be more general anyway thanks in advance for any advice you can offer this might be more an legaladvice question but because our specific needs are bank account specific thought ask here first,"You and your wife's generation want to help your father-in-law manage his finances, since he has been victim of a phone scam and is concerned about his ability to handle his money. You want to set up a bank account for his savings that your generation has access to, but wish for the account to be in his name only, for transparency reasons.

To accomplish this, you're wondering about the best way to co-own the property, and whether you can obtain a blended mortgage rate for both units. 

It is recommended that you consult with a legal professional who can provide tailored advice and guide you through the process of structuring the ownership and obtaining financing that suits your needs. They can also help you draft a cohabitation agreement that outlines the terms of ownership and responsibilities for the new property. 

It's important to note that obtaining a blended mortgage rate depends on the lender's criteria and approval process, and it's best to consult with a mortgage broker or financial advisor to explore your options. 

Remember to consider factors such as the current equity in your BR apartment, the amount you owe on your mortgage, your combined finances, and your future plans when deciding on the best approach."

Are you aware of the deadline to conduct a recharacterization? It must be completed by October 15th of the year after the contribution was made to your Roth IRA.

EverBank offers competitive rates, though they vary depending on the type of account and the term length. One potential downside is that EverBank's savings and money market accounts have high minimum opening requirements, but their checking accounts have no minimum requirements. EverBank is part of TIAA Bank, so you'll want to make sure you're comfortable with TIAA Bank's history and reputation as well. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide if the benefits of moving to EverBank outweigh the inconvenience of switching banks.

know technically there are weeks in month if you re doing the math for monthly income for the year weekly pay but do use this number if calculating to see how much would have for monthly expenses or should use as multiplier for my weekly pay am trying to figure out how much have to cover monthly expenses edit for example let say want to take on new expense expenses would be get paid week if do make just enough to cover expenses and in bad situation but if use make more month still not great but in safer spot guess could count that as my yearly savings but is it safe to do monthly let say have enough in savings to use as backup then not at risk right,"You would need to get paid more than just enough to cover your weekly expenses to create a monthly safety net.

currently have an auto loan with rate is it possible to sell my car put that money towards the new car and cough up the difference from my current loan amount to the remaining cost of the new car it seems silly that would have to close out my current loan just to take out new one with higher rate my lender has already borrowed the money from the government presumably at rate slightly lower than is there chance or am sol thanks,"You can sell your current car and use the proceeds to pay towards your auto loan, and then use any excess to put towards your new car. However, your current loan will still have to be paid off in full before you can take out a new loan for the new vehicle. It is possible to negotiate with your lender to see if they will allow you to pay off the balance of your loan early and potentially apply any excess proceeds from the sale of your vehicle towards the new loan. Each lender is different and it would depend on the specifics of your loan agreement. It is best to consult with your lender to understand your options. 

It is also important to note that selling your car and paying off your loan will not affect the interest rate on your current loan. The interest rate is determined by the terms of your loan agreement and is unaffected by any extra payments you make."

hi my parents took out parent plus loans to pay for my college expenses paying them back on top of my own student loans can still claim the student loan interest deduction on my taxes from the parent plus loans despite it being in their name or if not can they claim the deduction if the one making payments,"Parent Plus loans are considered to be a federal student loan, which means that the interest payments on them are deductible from your taxes. However, the loan must be in your name to claim the deduction, and you are the one who will receive the tax benefit, not your parents. They cannot claim the deduction separately if they are not the ones legally responsible for paying the interest on the loans. 

If your parents are making the payments on your Plus loans, you may still receive the tax deduction benefit as long as the loan is in your name. However, to claim the deduction, you need to be legally responsible for paying the loan and not your parents. 

Please consult a financial expert or tax professional to see how this will apply to your specific situation."

Given your current situation, here are some suggestions on what to do next:

1. Continue to look for a job in your field - Don't give up on finding a job in your preferred industry yet. Try to network and apply for as many relevant positions as possible. Consider temp agencies or freelance opportunities in your field to gain more experience and earn income.

2. Maintain your emergency fund - Given your irregular income, it's crucial to have a healthy emergency fund. Try to save up for 3-6 months' worth of expenses in your savings account.

3. Consider opening a savings account for your future car - You can open a savings account specifically for your car replacement fund to make it easier to save and keep track of your progress. Automate regular transfers from your checking account to this savings account.

4. Explore investing in your retirement - If you have maxed out your annual contributions to your Roth IRA for this year, you can consider investing in a regular brokerage account."

You have all the paperwork confirming the sale and the check for the amount agreed upon. What should you do? 

Description: Dealership tries to back out of buying my car

Options:

1. Appeal to the dealership: Explain that the car was sold as is with no issues, and produce the paperwork to support this. Insist upon honoring the deal as it stands. 
2. Get legal advice: Consult a lawyer to understand your rights under contract and consumer protection laws, and to determine the best way forward. 

3. Try to negotiate: If the dealership is willing to negotiate, you could propose a reduced price to account for the alleged motor issue. This may or may not be acceptable to you, depending on how much money you've already allocated for this sale. 

Remember, whenever dealing with potentially contentious situations, it's always good to document what transpires by saving texts, emails, and any other form of communication."

Each time, you've had to pay for repairs and deal with the inconvenience of not having a car while it is being fixed. Your trade-in value is worth more than the several thousand dollars you'd have to pay extra to buy a similar car, but you're not sure if you should trade in your car or just deal with the repeated cost and inconvenience of repairing your car. 

Are you interested in any particular make or model of car? I can provide you with information about different vehicles to help you make an informed decision. 

Would you like help with determining the total cost of ownership for each option? This would involve considering factors such as repair costs, insurance premiums, and the likelihood of theft or damage."
